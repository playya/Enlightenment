Here's what I had to do to get Evas_Quartz working on a fresh install of Mac OS X Leopard (Evas_Quartz is currently not versions prior to 10.5):

1) Install all system software updates.

2) Install the XCode developer tools (this includes GCC).

3) Install macports.

4) Put /opt/local/bin in your path, permanently. (I put it in front of everything else, because the newer versions of autotools provided by ports are required to build evas)

5) With macports, install the following: m4, autoconf, automake, libtool, pkgconfig, zlib, libpng, jpeg, freetype, tiff.

6) Check out a version of Evas that includes Evas_Quartz (from CVS).

7) Set up your environment. You need to, at the very least, set:
	CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
	LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib
	
8) Build and install eet.

9) Build and install evas. Make sure to use --enable-quartz when configuring!

****  A few different types of gradients don't currently draw.
**    Textbox drawing is a little bit off (because of hardcoded constants that shouldn't exist).
