Feb  3, 2002		dnd to move menu items within the menu.  There is a
			remaining bug dragging from submenus, it doesn't
			work yet. Fixed a hilite bug in the text entries.
			--
			External drag and drop into menu and individual menu 
			entries.  Dragging a app from a view into the menu
			will insert a new menu item with the name as the menu
			text, and the full path/exe as the executable.
			Dragging into one of the menu fields inserts
			depending on the target.  Exe gets full path, text
			gets just the name, icon gets full path.

Oct 18,	2001		Fixup for ecore changes.  Lots of renames.  No

			who you are, you ought to be slapped silly for this
			one. ;-)
