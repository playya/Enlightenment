COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

You need to use the e_util_eapp_edit application (as the user that will be
running engage, not root!) from CVS in e17/apps/e_utils to build icon files for your apps.
These icons are compatible with the upcoming e17 e_app icons and should live
in ~/.e/e/applications/all.

In ~/.e/e/applications/engage you need to place a .order file or however you
like to manage your icon lists in e17.

Unmatched windows will pick up the xapp.eap in the shared directory which has
no icon - _unless_ the theme overrides this icon!

Try using the "none" theme to start with and the "gentoo" theme for a nice
effect (both included) use "engage -t gentoo".

for animations such as a clock create a directory called
~/.e/apps/engage/sysicons and put in this your favourite animations
(try expedition.eet (analog clock) or digital.eet (digital clock) provided in
this directory for a start).
Valid files here are any .eet that has a "Main" part to load.
