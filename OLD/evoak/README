Evoak 0.0.1

Evoak is a canvas server. This is similar to an X server that serves out a
display and graphics operations. Evoak servers out a single canvas to be
shared by multiple applications (clients) allowing each client to manipulate
its set of objects.

Evoak is very much "experimental". The code is not that clean and needs to be
split up and modularised. But it is a good proof of concept and can be built
on. Note as well that Edje objects are only half-done and may need a lot of
refactoring. Comments, patches, help etc. are very desireable.

The current list of TODO's is:

1. make all objects dlopen()'ed module files in both the client library and
the server. This means splitting object up into their own subdirs and build
trees too.

2. implement a canvas manager protocol

3. finish off edje objects

4. add client-side smart objects

5. add server-side smart objects via embryo script/code

6. add container and arrangement objects

7. actually implement the protocol to work over tcp - this means supporting
upload requests from the server to upload fonts, images, edjes etc. if the
server does not have them and store them in a cache etc.

8. improvements, cleanups, documentation etc. etc.
