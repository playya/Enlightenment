		<h1>Introduction</h1> <br/>
		eVFS is a lightweight, yet powerful filesystem abstraction layer created using the 
		<a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment Foundation Libraries</a> (EFL).  It 
		aims to replace all common file functions in general application programming, whilst 
		maintaining the ability to interoperate between a variety of filesystem types, both
		local and remote. <p/>
		In contrast to other virtual filesystem offerings, eVFS offers only an asyncronous
		toolkit - that is, communication between the eVFS daemon, and a client application,
		occurs as a series of messages and responses, rather than taking control away from
		the client during operation execution.  Such a design ties in with the general 
		philosophy of the EFL - a threadless, yet responsive toolkit providing maximum 
		stability, whilst remaining powerful.
		
		<h1>Components</h1>
		eVFS comprises a number of components, not all of which you will need to become 
		familiar with.  The base components are:
		<ol>
			<li>The eVFS daemon</li>
			<li>The client library</li>
			<li>Modules</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Client/Server Interaction</h1>
			<h2>Daemon Connection</h2>
			A client wishing to make use of eVFS functionality must first connect to the daemon
			itself.  If the daemon is not running at the time of the connection request, a new
			eVFS daemon will be launched with the permissions of the current user.<p/>
			An eVFS connection object is a variable of the form:<p></p>
			<code>
			evfs_connection *con;
			</code><p/>
			To make a new connection to the eVFS daemon, you call the function <var>evfs_connect</var>,
			defined as:<p/>
			
			<code>evfs_connection *evfs_connect(void (*callback_func) (evfs_event *, void *), void* obj);</code><p/>
			The arguments are, in order, the callback function to call with command responses and events, and the object (if any) 
			return as a client-reference.
			<h2><var>evfs_filereference</var> object</h2><p/>
			An <var>evfs_filereference</var> is an abstract representation of a file on a filesystem.
			An evfs_filereference is defined as: <p/>
			<pre>
			typedef struct evfs_filereference
			{
			   char *plugin_uri;
			   struct evfs_plugin *plugin;

			   struct evfs_filereference *parent;
			   struct evfs_server *server;  /*The server that spawned/owns this fileref, if any */
	
			   evfs_file_type file_type;
			   char *path;

			   char *username;              /*The username/password pair (if any) required to hit this file */
			   char *password;

			   int fd;                      /*The file descriptor (if any) */
			   void *fd_p;
			} evfs_filereference;
			</pre>
			<p/>
			An evfs filereference can refer to a nested file (See the section on URIs in this manual).  That is to say, a 
			filereference can refer to a file in a .bz2, inside a .tar, on a remote samba share.  This is acheived through 
			the <var>parent</var> object, as seen above.  In each <var>evfs_filereference</var>, parent is set to either 
			another <var>evfs_filereference</var>, or NULL - with the NULL being at the top level.  The structure can be seen,
			for example, as below:<p/>
			<code>
			(tar) '/inner/directory/example.c' -> (bz2) files.tar.bz2 -> (samba) //machine/example
			</code>
			<p/>
			This would be expressed as a uri in the form:<p/>
			<code>
			smb:///machine/example/files.tar.bz2#bz2://#tar:///inner/directory/example.c
			</code>
			<br/><br/>
			Generally, as a user of the evfs client libraries, you will not need to manipulate filereferences 
			directly, but it is a good idea to become familiar with their internal structure, so as to understand
			their recursive nature.  Through the use of nested URIs, you can refer to any file, on any filesystem,
			or group of filesystems, that eVFS can manipulate.
			<h2>evfs_parse_uri</h2><p/>
			The <var>evfs_parse_uri</var> function turns a URI as seen above, into the nested filereference objects,
			thus automating the transition between a textual file format, and the eVFS internal representation.
