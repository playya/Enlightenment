An light-weight image viewer based on Elementary

To open an image, a bunch of images, or a bunch of directories, pass them as arguments.

Example of showing all images in the ~/Pictures directory:

image-viewer ~/Pictures

Navigation is done with the arrow keys and Space, where the right arrow key and Space change to the next image, and the left arrow switches to the previous image

The key <q> terminates the image-viewer. <ESC> also quits, unless the image viewer is showing a slideshow -- in that case it terminates the slideshow

Rudimentary zoom is supported with <+> and <->

The keys <1>, <2> and <3> change to various image viewing modes. <1> displays the image in 100%, <2> shrinks the image if bigger, and <3> is the same as <2>, but also enlarges the image if smaller.

<Delete> moves an image to the trash. No confirmation dialog is displayed.

<F12> opens up the settings window.

<F9> opens up a list of all images along with thumbnails, if the image-viewer is built with ethumb support

<e> starts a pre-set image editing program with the current image as an argument

<F11> or <f> toggle fullscreen mode

<F5> toggles the slideshow mode
