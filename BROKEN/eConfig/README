Welcome to eConfig 0.0.1 - this is a library that is supposed to abstractify
out the configuration interface from the application in a major way.  You give
it paths to save/load data from, and you tell it to save and load data.  It
should take care of finding the proper path to get the data from, finding the
correct data, sorting the searchpath order, etc.  This library is originally
intended for the configuration system for 0.17 and beyond of enlightenment.
You should be able to multiple apps running off the same configuration paths
and have eConfig also take care of all the locking.  Also it should mark data
as dirty and reload it from disk as soon as someone modifies the data on the
disk you have access to.  We really had some issues with the old configuration
system that weren't going to be solved by any trivial fixes to the old system,
so as always when the code outlived its usefulness we clobbered it and started
over.  

to compile:
./autogen.sh (with any parameters you need to use)
make
make test (to run the test applications)

Please watch the TODO list if you want to help out - patches are always
accepted.
