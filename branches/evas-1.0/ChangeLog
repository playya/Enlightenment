2011-01-31  ChunEon Park

	* Fix lurking free bug in key grabs.

2011-02-12  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix "rediculous scaling size" bug, where scaling images to
          sizes like 1 billion pixels high or wide caused evas to try
          allocate scaletables on the stack and the stack just couldn't
          handle it. Now it only allocates a table for the visible
          region which will always be sane, and even has insanity
          checks now. At worst you'll get an unrendered image if the
          values are silly and some slowness. No crashes.

2011-02-16  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Backported a patch for text object segfault.

2011-02-16  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Backported a patch for Evas_Encoding robustness

2011-02-20  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix bug in font string parsing that can result in a crash if a
          font element is long enough.

2011-02-22  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fixed bug smart calc array where it'd nuke the array when nested
          process calls hapen and leave some objects uncalculated, but
          removed from the array and marked as needing a calc thus never
          getting back into the array.

2011-02-27  Vincent Torri

	* Fixed static linking of the bmp and tga loaders

2011-03-07  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Fix segv when trying to set gl viewpoint with NULL ctx

2011-03-08  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix problem with different x vsync api between SGI and EXT flavor
        as they have the same base name, but different prototypes.

2011-03-09  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix bug with evas_object_del() calling DEL callback BEFORE
        the HIDE one.

2011-03-10  Sung W. Park

	* Fix bug with yinvert handling of native surfaces.

2011-03-10  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix issue with loading alpha BMP's with "check if all pixel alpha
        are 0 or not and then force alpha off if all are 0". This
        means you can never have a 100% empty/transparent BMP though
        in 32bpp mode.

2011-03-15  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix issues with clipping and map.

2011-03-18  Jiyoun Park

2011-03-19  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Caching and timestamp checker for image files made much more
        pedantic and it checks not just modified timestamp but also
        inode number, size, and on linux, the nanonsecond resolution
        timestamp as well.

	* Fix build of GL and static modules.

2011-04-06  Cedric Bail

2011-04-06  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix bug in GL engine with someone stealing the GLX context away
        as well as scissor clips when rotated output is not 0 (90, 180, 270).

2011-04-12  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        in the GL engine when using EGL/OpenGL-ES2
        * Fix SVG loader 2 phase loader having differing scale down code

        rows or columns that have any child spanning that column not
        able to expand.
        * Fix Evas table to use actual fractional weights, not just
        boolean expand/not expand from weight value.
