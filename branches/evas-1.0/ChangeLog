        * Fix "rediculous scaling size" bug, where scaling images to
          sizes like 1 billion pixels high or wide caused evas to try
          allocate scaletables on the stack and the stack just couldn't
          handle it. Now it only allocates a table for the visible
          region which will always be sane, and even has insanity
          checks now. At worst you'll get an unrendered image if the
          values are silly and some slowness. No crashes.

          getting back into the array.
