* Make it an elm module (or setting an env var without a module?) so I'll be able to remotely connect to elm apps.
* Split UI and actual program code (better to do the previous bullet first on the bullet above).
* Add "grab screenshot" button.
* Add a clipping range rectangle.
* Add special per object info, for example edje part names?
* When items are coloured, show the exact colour using a rect?
* Handle map/proxy
* Add an option to filter out invisible/clippers

* Things to show per-object
  * clipping info.
  * callback list?
