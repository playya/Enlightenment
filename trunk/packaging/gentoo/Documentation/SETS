Dynamic sets:

@efl-rebuild	= rebuilds all installed packages from this overlay.
                  nice for rebuilding, as it will rebuild also
                  enlightenment-specific dependencies (simple rerun of
                  emerge on some static set will not). If not using
                  portage with sets support (<2.2), then use the
                  following command:
                  Documentation/scripts/sets/enlightenment.rebuild.sh

@efl-all	= all ebuilds from overlay, excluding those listed
		  into @efl-broken (see below). Still broken ebuild
		  might be fetched as dependencies. Use it, if you
		  want to install and try all known packages of
		  enlightenment. If not using portage with sets
                  support (<2.2), then use the following command:
                  Documentation/scripts/sets/enlightenment.all.sh

Static sets:
	Meta sets:

		@enlightenment = @enlightenment-modules + @enlightenment-wm
		@enlightenment-extended = @enlightenment + @efl-misc

@enlightenment-wm	= Pure wm install with deps, no modules, no others.

@enlightenment-modules	= All e-modules and all known to developers
                          third-party working modules.


@efl-misc	= Additional programs considered to be especially useful.
                  Includes dependencies.

@efl-proto	= Programs considered to be prototypes or some
		  testing ground. Sometimes it will just not compile,
		  but sometimes it may contains something geniuos and
		  awesome. Includes dependencies.

@efl-python     = Python bindings and utilities. Includes dependencies.
