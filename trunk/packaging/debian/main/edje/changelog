    - Drop patches, no longer needed:
      + 0002-fix-library-soname.patch
      + 0003-reapply-autofoo.patch
    - Package renaming due to upstream SONAME change.
      + Update shlibs and .install files as a consequence
  * Update Standards-Version, no change needed
  * Move libedje-dbg to the debug section
  * libedje-dev now depends on libedje-bin, as it's needed to compile themes
  * Package name purposedly doesn't match SONAME, in an attempt to make the
    former a bit more meaningful than libedje-ver-pre-01-0
    - Override the lintian warning: package-name-doesnt-match-sonames
