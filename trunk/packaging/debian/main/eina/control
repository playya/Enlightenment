Description: debugging symbols for use with libeina
 Eina is a multi-platform library that provides optimized data types and a few
 tools. It supports the following data types:
  - Array
  - Hash Table

 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier
 to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in /usr/lib/debug and
 are automatically used by gdb.
