eina (0.9.9.063-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add debian/patches/01_fix_compile_kbsd.diff:
    - Fix FTBFS on kfreebsd, thanks to Cyril Brulebois (Closes: #560745)
  * Add debian/patches/02_eina_test_rbtree_timeout.diff:
    - Some tests in the testsuite take a long time to run, causing FTBFS on
      several architectures, as the default timeout is 4 seconds. Wait for 5
      minutes instead, that should be enough. (Closes: #560742)
  * debian/rules: make the check-stamp target depend on build-arch

eina (0.0.2.062-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer build with -O3
  * Prevent the doc from being built when it's not needed. Allows moving
    doxygen to Build-Depends-Indep
  * No longer use DEB_DH_STRIP_ARGS, CDBS handles that automatically
  * debian/copyright: update download location and website URL
  * Add support for running the testsuite during the build (ignore the
    result for now, though, as there's still a testsuite bug that needs
    fixing)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3

eina (0.0.2.062-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot
  * This time the API broke, so drop the patches and use the upstream soname

eina (0.0.2.061-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot
    - Re-add patches to fix library soname. Upstream bumps the SONAME on every
      new snapshot, but no API/ABI changes happened between 0.0.2.060 and
      0.0.2.061, so let's use the SONAME currently used in the archive
  * Update shlibs, as new symbols were added
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.2, no change required
  * Upload to unstable

eina (0.0.2.060-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New SVN snapshot
    - Drop patches, no longer needed
    - Package renaming due to upstream SONAME change.
      + Update shlibs and .install files
  * Move libeina-dbg to the new debug section
  * Package name purposedly doesn't match SONAME, in an attempt to make the
    former a bit more meaningful than libeina-ver-pre-01-0
    - Override the lintian warning: package-name-doesnt-match-soname
