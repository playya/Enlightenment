Bling Module
************
EFLized Composite Manager for E17

By Ibukun Olumuyiwa

DO NOT USE THIS MODULE. I REPEAT, DO *NOT* USE THIS MODULE.

It is not anywhere ready for end-users. It has too many bugs and you may 
lose valuable data. You have been warned.

This module is only in CVS for developers who want to help fix bugs and
add features/make the code more mature. Also the name "bling" is a working
title and may not be the final name for this module (or it may eventually
be merged into the main e17 tree). Please see the TODO file for a list of
outstanding bugs and unfinished items.
