BUGS
==============================================
* Config doesn't save.
* E17 crash dialog doesn't show (need to unredirect windows
  in the event of a SEGV).
* Focus in/out fades may not always work especially if window is
  still in transition.

PLANNED FEATURES
==============================================
* Complete configuration dialog
* Save/cache window pixmaps for "expose"-type functionality
* Alternate window transitions (zoom, stretch etc.)
