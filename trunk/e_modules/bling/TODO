BUGS
==============================================
* Fading is horribly broken, and may need to be reworked altogether.
* All active windows are lost upon E17 restart.
* Config doesn't save. Haven't had time to attend to this.
* Shadow offset/opacity needs fixing.


MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
==============================================
* Make unfocused windows translucent
* Save/cache window pixmaps for "expose"-type functionality
* Alternate window transitions (zoom, stretch etc.)
