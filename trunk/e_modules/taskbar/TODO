BUGS

- if the horiz shelf is resized (huge, tiny) the app icons aren't layed out
  optimally (in the vertical)
- if shelf is set to 'scroll contents' things kind of work, but...
    events don't always seem to be caught
    when switched to 'scroll contents' size will be wrong

- raster: taskbar doesn't want to be removed from the configure
  shelf contents dialog

- vert layout - no...

TODO

- In non-scroll mode, apps will fill the shelf and disappear off the end
- Modify populate function to either sort in a deterministic way or remember
  app order, because:
    When you switch desktops, the order of taskbar apps can change.  This is
    odd behavior for users who will probably expect the app order in the
    bar to be the same as when they left the desktop.
- Other layour options (to fit all apps on the shelf)
    Scroll and shrink - zoom the app under the mouse, but shrink others to fit
                        on the shelf
    Sort apps by category and stack - Place apps of the same name under one
                                      app icon, pop a list when clicked.
                                      (Or on mouse over?)


Behavior decisions

- (Is this an Xnest problem?  It works for iamsthitha.)
  when an app is behind another app on the desktop, and you click on the
  taskbar, the app will get focus, but be hidden.  Should we raise?
  Should it follow current wm behavior for 'raise on click'?
