Emu is an exercise in Zen programming.

First of all, I have written it not by learning anything about how E17
works, but by cutting and pasting from pre existing code.  Thus I have
kept my mind free.

Second, the purpose of the emu module is ta allow others to write E17
modules without any knowledge of the internal workings of E17 modules,
or even any knowledge of the C programming language.

Emu is an E17 module front end that runs arbitrary back ends written in
any language.  Emu provides a high level interface to some of the things
that modules typically do.  The backends can be written by anybody in
any language.
