FIXME: Once in a blue moon, the menus don't show up.

Add internal actions, same things that can be bound to keys can be 
requested by the client to be done instead of a string being sent back.
Also new command to do these internal actions on request.

For window events that trigger actions, use the same hooks that pager does.

For the category callback stuff -
  make some way to pass some info from the category data to the exe
    window id for the window menu
    full path to the file for the efm menu

There will always be one face, with at least the default drop zone for 
adding more exes.

Use directories with .order files to specify the executables.

One directory per face.

One emu icon (or eap icon) on face per exe, in order.

Use an image of an emu egg (or directory eap) as a drop zone for adding
new exes.

Use an image of a cluster of emu eggs (or directory eap) as a button
that opens a drawer, which are further sub directories.  NOTE no drawers
on default face, cause  directories there mean "other face".

Each place that allows an icon should also allow an edje.

Each emu (exe) can have -
    changable icon / edje
    text
    OK dialogs
    yes/no dialogs
    drop zone
    graphling
    Stuff added to the config menu (for main menu and right click menu)
