Thanks for downloading my mount module !

First, make sure your /etc/fstab has the user (or users depending on your distro) option for the mountpoints you want displayed. 
Here's an example:

/dev/hdc	/mnt/dvd	iso9660		noauto,noatime,ro,user 0 3

Now you can issue autogen.sh && make && make install to install the module.

To load the module execute enlightenment_remote -module-load mount

Click a device icon to mount the device. You will see a lock appear if the device was successfully mounted. 
Clicking again will umount the device.
