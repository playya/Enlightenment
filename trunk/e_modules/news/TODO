BUGS

----------------------------------------------------
NEEDED (to do more or less in this order)
----------------------------------------------------

 - feed icons (new file ?)
Evas_Object *news_feed_icon_add(News_Feed *feed)
void         news_feed_icon_del(Evas_Object *obj)
void         news_feed_icon_refresh(Evas_Object *obj)
evas_object_data_set the feed on the icon
evas_object_event_callback_add(EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE) on the icon, that remove the obj from feed->icons
   to get a feeds icon : an edje obj, with icon swallowed
   so we can put in menu / item / ilists, to have animated things every where, linked and consistant (state refresh calls news_feed_icon_refresh(feed))
   add an "attached" state, to show that the feed is attached to an item. for example, a circle border aroung the icon ?
   enable/disable state changes for each icon, with options on the _icon_add() and "can_..." data attached to the icon's evas_object
   so mybe then no feed for news_viewer_feed_refresh() and config_dialog_refresh_feed() ...
 - feeds option "icon glint on news"
 - news_feed_ilist_get(News_Item *item)
   + news_feed_category_ilist_get()
   if item is not NULL, get the selected feeds (= feeds of the item)
           is NULL, get the whole feeds list (with categories ...)
              (implement multi sel everywhere in main dialog, feeds list; usefull for delete feeds)
   news_category_ilist_get
 - news_viewer_feed_refresh -> refresh label and icon of a feed
news_config_dialog_refresh_feed
news_config_dialog_item_refresh_feed
  items_get
  while { nth_data_get() == feed }
  nth_icon_set
  nth_label_set
to avoid refresh the ilist

 --- WAIT FOR FEED ICONS ---
 - viewer: dont reselect current feed in viewer when a feed has updated with changes
 - viewer: when an article goes to "as read" and "feeds first" option, refresh the feeds list but don't reselect the feed, go on top of the list
 - use a "changed" attribute to things, to detect what has to be refresh when refresh() is called. to avoid refresh things for nothing, so avoid user ilists changer for nothing
 ---

[Parse]
 - parse html chars (in _item_clean ?)
 - reparse infos every time, if changes ... ?
 - handle the fact that sometimes we loose feeds (connection timeout ...) so sometimes, keep feeds that are READ, to avoid having feeds marked as unread, but wich where read before
   -> compare description of feed just parsed with suspect precedent one
its not that slow (use memcmp, keep description_size)

[Item]
 - show as selected the feed selected in viewer
 - mouse over -> bump icon a bit
 - unread feeds : glint every /10s ? on a global beat ?
   
 - unread feeds : put the red color on top if icon alpha = 0
 - item actions on mouse over / left click / wheel, like in photo
 - option to have label on each feed icon
 - wheel on an item makes the viewer go to next/prev (unread?) article
 - loading state
 - maybe a BUG with add / remove feeds in an item (MODE_FEED)
   it has hang on time, in while(o = e_box_..._first(box)) { unpack }
   ... needs testing

[Config_Dialog]
 - e patch for ilist : e_widget_ilist_selected_set, when there are labels, selects the good feed but the view goes at the end of the ilist
 - e patch for ilist : (dialog_item/viewer when refresh and dont selected_set after, the view goes up of one item
 - when changing order / modify feeds / categories
in the main config panel, make the state of the 
config panel as INCHANGED
= dont enable "ok" and "apply"
 - ? dont allow move categories ?
 - ? item: category ilist to quickly find a feed ?
 - e_config_dialog_find for all config dialogs ...
   it needs E patch
 - clean config_dialog_data (use sub structs ...)
 - ? news_widget_feeds ? an ilist of feeds, sorted ... other things like that ?
 - ? dialog: default button for viewer font, needs rewrite some things ... ?
 - ? main/item: show language flag in ilist
e patch : add ability to have a 2nd image on the right of ilist items (we can show module activation in modules list. (raster adreed, go!, and send to ml) ?
is it really usefull ? language offen appears in the name, and we have a language selector ...

[Viewer]
 - appear with sliding animation in option ?
 - when refresh viewer, try not to move the ilist view,
cause when you are watching it at the same time, its very anoying
   needs e ilist patch ?
 - news viewer refresh position function ?
 - ? viewer: instead of having 'own lists', get the pos of feeds/articles via going through ilist items (e_widget_ilist_items_get && e_widget_ilist_nth_data_get), counting and looking data field ?

[Popup_Warn]
 - everything

[Feed]
 - patch to ecore_con to avoid segv when ecore_con_server_del on a server wich has not astablished connection yet
 - popup an error if the feed doesnt want to refresh
(with a timeout timer on waiting reply ...)
 - proxy tests
 - add default feeds
 - save articles on unload ?
 - DIDNT FIND BETTER ... :
   rethink the stupid system that _detach, but not really.
   linked with the Feed_Ref thing
   -> ??? detach feeds, feed refs
 when shutdown the module, specify if whe want a real delete (done)
 but why is it unsur ? we should be able to know is the shutdown call
 comes from my code (->detach) or outside ???

[*]
 - move some things from .h to .c (private things ...)
 - help dialog (mouse on viewer vcontent for example ...)
 - fix all TODO and FIXME in the code

[Parse]
 - ? charset ? already ok ? i believe not =)
 - display feed language
 - images
	for items :
		<enclosure url="..">, look if its an image
	for channels :
		<image> -> <url>
		<rss:image> for <= 1.0
		favicon.ico
 - get the favicon.ico for the feed icon, or set a genereric icon if not

[Viewer]
 - capacitee de suivre des flux d'images, et de sav les images
pour que Photo par exemple les reprenne derriere ds le repertoire où on a save la photo
"mode images" genre entice, pour voir toutes les images d'un coup (cf <lok>) ?

[Config Dialog]
 - add an auto attach dialog, when you create a new feed
(disable option)

[Browser]
 - possibility to have a little browser window in front of
the shelf, to see a news options to remember, place ...

----------------------------------------------------
FUTUR
----------------------------------------------------

 - think about a new way of interaction with the wm
 - search info about getting feeds where youre need to be logged
