With these sources, you can build a module with different possible features.
Features avalaible:
  - photo: Display pictures

You can create a module with ALL these features, called dEvian
  OR you can create a module with only ONE feature, wich will have a DIFFERENT NAME.
A module with only picture feature will be called dEphoto
A module with only rss feature will be called dErss
A module with only log feature will be called dElog

dEphoto is created by ./autogen.sh --enable-modular=photo
