------------------------------------------------------
- 2 distinct themes (switchable via menu)
Working:
   - one with a top image & one without
   - top image can be changed by placing your 
     own edj files. Hints on making your own 
	topimage edj, top part (image) takes 35% of overall 
	calendar next 15% is taken up for the Year,Month,
 	Days and each row of dates is 9%.

   - Config without topimage has the backimage.edj
     file.  It's only requirement is that the group
     be named "back".  Note the edj shipped with 
     the calendar has a png that is transparent.
     -- Hints on making your own background, The 
     	top part (Year, Month, Days) is in a box
	which goes down 15% of the overall image.
	Each row of dates is 15% high. 

Not Working:
	- switching from one theme to another more
	  than once causes the date blocks to go white.

- colors completely configurable (on the fly)
Working:
   - can have different colors for weekday, 
      weekend and today
   - can change color scheme by editing 
     a simple config file
   	-- an example config file is included in the calendar src directory.
	   All that is needed is to modify the numbers, then use the "File Selection -> Config File"
	   to set the path to your file.  The use the "read config file" option to read it in.
		r Object Red value // r1 Outline Red value // r2 Shadow Red value 
		g Object Green value // g1 Outline Green value // g2 Shadow Green value 
		b Object Blue value // b1 Outline Blue value // b2 Shadow Blue value 
		a Object Alpha(Transparency) value // a1 Outline Alpha value // a2 Shadow Alpha value
	  colors in config file go: r, g, b, a, r1, g1, b1, a1, r2, g2, b2, a2.
	  (To have config file read, you must select the "read config file" option from the calendar menu.

- fonts/size also configurable
Working:
   - change fonts via a simple configuration 
     file
	-- same location and file as for colors example will be included soon - if 
	   one wants to try it now, a font line will look like:
	   YM_text_class <font> <font size>
	   Day_text_class <font> <font size>
	   text_class <font> <font size>
	   New font must be in "evas font path"

Themers:
 -- There are 6 edj files that make up the calendar module.
	-- The calendar edj only provides a structure & location for arrows 
           for selecting next/prev years/months
	-- topimage.edj provides the top part (given it's visible)
	-- background.edj provides the calendar background (and is always used)
	-- today.edj is as it seems, block for today
	-- weekend.edj
	-- weekday.ed	
        -- arrow.edj used for the arrows for next/prev month/year

Please look at the default edj's to see the basic structure.  Group names 
need to be "default" and "user" -- and yes you need both.  The "default"
group is everything to define it how you want it to look, the "user" part
is so that a user can modify color scheme (if he/she so chooses).  To create 
the "user" group just copy the "default" group add the colorclass and textclass
lines from the edj's I provided and remove any lines with colors defined.  Otherwise,
these are standard edj's.
