First in the config dialog you have two options: 
	(i) Be so smart as win_must_die does, and 
	(ii) be suitable for advanced users like everybody on this list. 

If the first option is selected, then each scrapshot is saved in /tmp, or ~/tmp and the priview box is displayed with a thumbanailed scrapshot image, and two buttons "Close" and "Save As....". In the Advanced case, i'd leave the behaviour of the ss as is.

Add option for View With to open an image viewer after the shot is taken.
