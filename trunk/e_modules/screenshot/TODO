First in the config dialog you have two options: 
	(i) Be so smart as win_must_die does, and 
	(ii) be suitable for advanced users like everybody on this list. 

If the first option is selected, then each scrapshot is saved in /tmp, 
or ~/tmp and the preview box is displayed with a thumbanailed scrapshot image, 
and two buttons "Close" and "Save As....". 

In the Advanced case, i'd leave the behaviour of the ss as is.
