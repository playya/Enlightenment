This file provides details of modules that are currently broken and will
not compile.  These modules may be removed if they stay broken for a
long time.


calendar (REMOVED) - Broke when the long advertised move from gadman to
gadcon was completed and the gadman code was removed from E17.  The
author plans to get back to it, but has no idea when.

engage (REMOVED) - Broke when the long advertised move from gadman to
gadcon was completed and the gadman code was removed from E17.  The
author plans to get back to it, but has no idea when.  Both the
e_modules maintainers have expresed an interest in fixing it, but all
three of us have this as a low priority task, and have many other higher
priority tasks to take care of.  In the mean time, the standalone
version is in misc/engage, and it will be kept limping along for now.
