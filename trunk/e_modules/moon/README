Moon Clock module for Enlightenment 0.17.0

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

This module is a port of the e16 E-MoonClock epplet.  
The module supplies a gadget that displays information about the current phase of the moon.

The default theme re-uses moon phase images from the e16 E-MoonClock.
The sky image is from the e17 "bling bling" theme.
Moon phase calculation routines are also re-used.
The rest was mainly written by the AUTHORS. 

Feel free to send suggestions or problem reports to the AUTHORS
And have fun :)
