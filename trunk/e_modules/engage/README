This is the e17 engage module which features real transparency and fits nicely
in the sexiest window manager out there :)

To use it compile as before (you must have e17 installed when you run
./configure (or ./autogen.sh) ) then with e17 running type:

enlightenment_remote -module-load engage
enlightenment_remote -module-enable engage

enjoy
