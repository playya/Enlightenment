0. Optimize language switching functionality. It is too slow for per window policy.

1. Fix the configure.in file in order to have dependencies to X11 and xkbfile
   libraries.

2. Remove all FIXMEs.

3. Fix the lang_language_current_kbd_model_get() to return the actual value.

4. Introduce country flags for the face box, and for the list icons in the config
   dialog and in the face menu.

5. Think on language switch policy :
      a) Global
      b) Per Window
      c) ????

6. Memleaks? forget somewere to clear list or remove an item from it?
