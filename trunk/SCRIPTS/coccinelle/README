ecocci.h is the file to be passed to Coccinelle as -macro_file_builtins.
It's easier to run against all code base, but you'll achieve better results
if you run individually for each project


Basic usage:

spatch -sp your-semantic-patch.cocci -macro_file_builtins /path-to/ecocci.h \
       -all_includes -relax_include_path -dir ./

 -sp <file>: give the semantic patch to apply
 -macro_file_builtins <file>: give the .h file with macro definitions
 -all_includes: needed in order to correctly handle #include "file.h"
 -relax_include_path: needed in order to search for header also on current dir
 -dir: the directory to patch
