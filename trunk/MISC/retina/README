Retina - evas powered image viewer

ok so this project has been dead since 2000 for various reasons.  i've picked
it back up and started rewriting it from scratch using all the new EFL libs.
mostly doing this as a learning experience and something to meddle with when
i'm bored.  if it turns into something widely used, cool, if it doesn't, i'll
be just the same.

current limitations - you can only run out of this dir, no make install or
anything yet.  i need to relearn how to use automake to do all of that cool
guy stuff again.  if anyone wants to write some autoconf scripts for it, hey,
thats cool too.
