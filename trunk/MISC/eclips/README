Eclips 0.0.4  by Hisham Mardam Bey <hisham@hisham.cc>
-----------------------------------------------------
eclips is an image viewr based on Ecore, Evas and Imlib2. It is designed to
do one thing and one thing only; display refreshing slideshows or single
images (webcams) while providing variable desktop translucency to blend
easily into the background. Eclips is specialized in cool effects like
fading in and out when changing images, keeping constant background
transparency to provide three or more visual layers, and many more. 

History:
--------
I usually have a window which displays my webcam image, and another window
which has a constant slideshow. Typically, they're using a borderless app
which I have placed in some corner of the screen. Then, I suddenly found out
that having those windows changing every now or then on my desktop was kind
if distracting. So, I decided to come up with a way to make them less
distracting. Henceforth, eclips was born.


Installation:
-------------
To install, edit Makefile and change the PREFIX to the location you want. Then:

./autogen.sh or ./configure
make
make install (as root)

to run, just type: eclips <filename>

For usage information, try: eclips -h
