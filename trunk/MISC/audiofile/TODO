Audio File Library 0.1.7
Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

Short-term:
Fix querying on instrument parameters and loops.

Correctly handle initialisation of file handles from file setups by
paying attention to what was specified and what was not specified
(i.e. which values were left as default).

Longer-term:
(These will hopefully be resolved by version 0.2.)

Add locale support for error messages.

Documentation should probably be in the SGML DocBook format.

Sample rate conversion needs to be handled.

Some compressed data formats need to be handled.

Error values aren't always returned and may not always be proper.
More research should be done here.

Distant future:
PCM mapping will be handled when I have nothing better to do.

More comprehensive tests should be developed to stress-test the
library (especially in the area of error values).

Thread-safe error handling would be very nice.  I will probably have to
implement SGI's digital media library error handling routines.  I don't
think this will require that much modification.
