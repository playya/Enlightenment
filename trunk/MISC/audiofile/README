This Audio File Library is an implementation of the SGI Audio File
library.  Since the latter is specified ambiguously in places, I've
taken some liberties in interpreting certain such ambiguities.  At the
present, not all features of the SGI Audio File library are
implemented.  I feel, though, that this implementation of the Audio
File Library offers enough functionality to be useful for many
tasks.

This library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio
files of many common formats (currently AIFF, AIFC, WAVE, and
NeXT/Sun).

This software is not complete and is still under development.  Many
sound file formats work well.  Some will not.

Very little documentation is available for the Audio File Library at
present. If you wish to consult a decent reference, you'll have to look
at SGI's man pages (man afIntro).  For now, all that exists are my
sample programs and the meager offerings in the docs directory.  Anyone
who'd like to help out with documentation is encouraged to contact me.

Please note that the Audio File Library itself is available under the
GNU Library General Public License and that the programs in this
package are available under the GNU General Public License.  The two
licenses are included in the files COPYING and COPYING.GPL,
respectively.
