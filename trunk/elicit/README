Winter Theme
------------

Click on the scope target and drag around to zoom in on the section of the screen under the mouse.
Click and drag the eye dropper to select the color under the mouse.

Click on the left border to open up a panel of tools.
In the first tab, the Red, Green, Blue, Hue, Saturation, and Value values of the current color will be shown, along with the Hex (rgb) representation and the current Zoom level.

Click and hold down on the small up and down arrows to modify the color values. Alternatively, scroll the mouse wheel while over a color value.

To copy the hex value, click on it.

Changing the Zoom value will affect any subsequent zooms.

The second tab stores any saved swatches. To save a swatch, left click on the swatch in the pain section of the gui. To load a saved swatch, left click on it in the panel. To delete a saved swatch, right click on it in the panel.

The third tab is for stored zooms. These function similarly to the swatches. Click on the main zoom area to save.

The fourth tab show all currently available themes (Winter and Summer are provided).

Summer Theme
------------
The summer theme functions similarly to the Winter one, except that the swatch and shot tabs are combined into a single one. To access the panel, click the small plus sign.

Scrolling on color values to change them is not yet implemented in Summer.


Enjoy :)
