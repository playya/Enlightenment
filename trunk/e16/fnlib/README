If you have picked up a net release of fnlib you should be able to
just follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.

If you are using imlib out of the CVS repository, then you need to
have some extra tools installed, and the configuration process is
lengthier.  the HACKING file has all the details for building from a
CVS checkout.

Fnlib requires Imlib, (1.1 or later 1.3 preferably) and requires that Imlib
have NATIVE loading support for libtiff, libpng and libgif (ie GIF, TIFF and
PNG files).
