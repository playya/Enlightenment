BUGS:
raster: 	must update dox docs fully
cK:		keeping the groups file in sync with the existing groups that need to be remembered. I'm sure there are bugs in that.
mandrake:   kde tasklist and pager names don't show up, and don't update when enlightenment changes things.  needs fixing

FEATURES:
raster: 	add dnd to iconbox

FEATURES FOR DR 0.17:
kainx: 		reduce need for tooltip text to have auto gened tooltips work
user: 		spacers in menus
user: 		"default button" indicator for the default "enter" activated button
user: 		add submenu resistance / timeout for running across to a submenu
user: 		add "virtual" resistance boxes
user: 		finer grained control on selecting icon display policy
raster: 	need to lock .enlightenment dir for multiple logins etc.
cK: 		something like that 'virtual desktop hovering' thing that fvwm has, i.e. continuous dragging of the desktop areas. Maybe something like a 'supergroup' that every window belongs to, and then moving that group ...
cK:             maybe some kind of helpdesk? Like hitting F1 gives help in dialogs or something

BUGS TO BE FIXED for 0.17:
mandrake: 	I'm sure that focus code has bugs in it somewhere.  just needs to be completely rewritten, basically

THOUGHTS/IDEAS:
cK: 		Some of the group dialogs could work with check- instead of radiobuttons.  Like the one for breaking groups, for example.
