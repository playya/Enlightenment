BUGS to FIX:
------------

(*) autoarrange needs to better handle "no space left on display" rather than 
just putting window int he middle (and still needs to avoid panel etc.)
(*) dragbar doesn't unpress when you release mouse button 2/3
(*) focus code cleanup -- context_ewin vs focuswin vs realfocuswin
(*) edge resistance while in click to focus - window from bottom will appear on
the top when flipping.
(*) wow, dox seems to chew up memory for no good reason.

    it starts out at like 2.7 megs and somehow grows to 16.  memory leak? naah
	:)  gains about 300-500k every time I change pages, indefinitely.  never
	frees the memory, still gains when I visit a page I've already been to.
