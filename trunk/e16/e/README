Thank you for downloading the 0.16.7 release of the Enlightenment Window
Manager.  This README file should not be considered a substitute for the real
documentation, which can be found (once you have started Enlightenment) by
middle-clicking on the desktop and selecting "Help" from the menu.

Information on how to install Enlightenment on your system is contained in the
INSTALL file.  Please consult the INSTALL file for information on how to get
Enlightenment compiled and running on your system.

There is a minor FAQ that is replicated from the documentation found in the
file FAQ.  The version in the Documentation Browser is more helpful, but this
is included for completeness.

Information on the copyright, and your rights as a user of enlightenment can be
found in the file COPYING, which is also contained in this directory.
Enlightenment is free software, and you should know that you are entitled to
many rights as a user.

Curious about who wrote the application?  Check out the AUTHORS file for more
information.  For patches, we try to remember who submitted what patch so you
know who to thank for particular features.  If you like a feature, send them
some email - they'll probably appreciate it.

The primary Enlightenment site is located at:
http://www.enlightenment.org 

IF you would like to join Enlightenment-related mailing lists, you can find out
more information on these lists at:

Thanks for taking the time to read the README file.  We hope you enjoy this
software as much as we have enjoyed writing it for you.
