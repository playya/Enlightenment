About 0.16.8
============

Changes:
- "enlightenment" has been renamed to "e16".
- The default user configuration directory is "~/.e16".
- The data install path is "<somepath>/e16", e.g. "/usr/share/e16".
Thus, an e16.8 installation should not clash with any other versions.
- Various configuration file formats have changed and should be easier
  to read and modify, if needed.
- The configuration is stored per display and per screen.  E.g. for
  DISPLAY=:1.0 the main configuration file is "~/.e16/e_config--1.0.cfg".
- Actions(used by menus, keybindings, etc.) and IPC functions(eesh) have
  been merged.
- Many IPC(eesh) commands have been changed, possibly breaking compatibility
  with a few epplets.
- Window matches and icondefs have been merged (into matches.cfg), see below.

New features:
- Built-in composite manager.
- An iconbox can be configured to act as System Tray
  (middle mouse->Desktop->Create Systray).
- Possibility to run programs on initial startup and on restart.
- Possibility to track changes in remembered settings.
- Window operations by window matches (class, name, transient, ...),
  e.g. for making all windows of a certain type sticky, put it on a certain
  layer, etc. (see matches.cfg).

Notes:

NB!!! imlib2 >= 1.2.0 is required.

All settings can be shown and set using eesh.
To get a full list of settings:
$ eesh show
To set some parameter:
$ eesh set <parameter> <value>
Some settings will not be effective until E is restarted.

To get a list of other eesh commands:
$ eesh help full

If window resize/shading with composite enabled is ugly, try:
$ eesh set compmgr.resize_fix_enable 1

0.16.8 should still be compatible with any e16 theme. However, user installed
themes will have to be moved/linked to ~/.e16/themes/ or <datadir>/e16/themes/.

e16keyedit will work, but the "Action" field is no longer used. In stead, the
action (IPC command) must be specified in the "Parameters" field.
If used to change the keybindings, the modified settings will be stored in
~/.e16/e_config.bindings.
It should also be fairly straightforward to modify the key- and buttonbindings
by editing /usr/share/e16/config/bindings.cfg.

e16menuedit will no longer work. e16menuedit2 will.

It is now possible to execute scripts on startup and/or restart. Use
$ eesh set misc.session.cmd_init <script>
to set the "init" script, and
$ eesh set misc.session.cmd_start <script>
to set the "start" script.
The "init" script is executed only the first time e16 starts during an X
session, and the "start" script is executed every time e16 (re)starts.

Do not rename ~/.enlightenment to ~/.e16. It will only cause trouble.


Configuration files
-------------------
Skip this section unless you *really* want to know...

It is here assumed that --prefix is /usr, and that the default user
configuration directory (~/.e16) is used.
Localization is ignored for simplicity.

In general, the configuration search order for theme related configuration
files, say xyz.cfg, is:
1) User configuration directory, i.e. ~/.e16/xyz.cfg.
2) Theme directory, i.e. /usr/share/e16/themes/<theme>/xyz.cfg, or
   ~/.e16/themes/<theme>/xyz.cfg.
3) Default configuration directory, i.e. /usr/share/e16/config/xyz.cfg.

Mouse and keybindings are defined in bindings.cfg, and optionally in
~/.e16/e_config.bindings. The latter may be generated as a result of using
e16keyedit.
bindings.cfg is loaded first, and searched in
1) User configuration directory, i.e. ~/.e16/bindings.cfg.
2) Default configuration directory, i.e. /usr/share/e16/config/bindings.cfg.
~/.e16/e_config.bindings is loaded next, and will override settings
defined in bindings.cfg.

Window matches (border and icon associations) are defined in windowmatches.cfg
and matches.cfg.
windowmatches.cfg (deprecated, border associations only) is loaded first,
and should be found only in theme directories.
matches.cfg is loaded next, and searched in
1) User configuration directory, i.e. ~/.e16/matches.cfg.
2) Default configuration directory, i.e. /usr/share/e16/config/matches.cfg.
Window match items are appended to the window match list, in the order
in which they are read from the configuration files.
When doing border/icon matches, the window match list is searched from the
start, and the first matching item will be used.


Migrating from Enlightenment 0.16.7 to 0.16.8 
---------------------------------------------
By Peter Hyman (pete4abw@comcast.net)

Users upgrading from enlightenment 0.16.7 need to read the following.

Several organizational changes have occurred that will require
some manual adjustments. Mainly these deal with changes to 
configuration and shared directory names. This was done to avoid
collisions with the new enlightenment DR17.

1) home configuration directory is now ~/.e16, not ~/.enlightenment.
2) menu files have been moved to a subdirectory called menus
   you will need to move customized menus and subdirectories to
   ~/.e16/menus. Note: because of this menu files will have to have
   menus/ prepended to it in order to be located. Ex:
   file.menu file...
   "User Menus"
   "User Application list" NULL menu "menus/user_apps.menu"
   whereas the old menu version did not have menus/. 
3) you will need to move ~/.enlightenment/backgrounds files to ~/.e16
   and any themes as well.
4) $prefix/share/enlightenment has been changed to $prefix/share/e16
5) if installed E-docs and Epplet directories will have to be moved 
   to $prefix/share/e16
6) any additional themes that were added to the $prefix/share/enlightenment
   directory will have to be moved to $prefix/share/e16
7) any startup scripts or Session scripts that reference the startup
   executable `enlightenment` must be edited to the new e16 program.
