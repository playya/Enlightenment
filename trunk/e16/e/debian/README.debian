enlightenment for DEBIAN
----------------------

The Enlightenment window manager package.  
It now complies with the FHS (Thanks DrMike & KainX!).  You can
now build your own .debs of CVS if you so choose, since the debian
specific files are going to be commited to the source tree.  Just run
'debian/rules binary' and you'll be set. If you have questions, just
email me.
