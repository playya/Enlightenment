Description: The Enlightenment Window Manager
 Enlightenment - the window manager that dares to do what others don't.
 It features KDE and GNOME integration, multi-program sound support,
 iconification, sliding desktops, docking, epplets, and much more.
 Enlightenment takes the concepts of themes to another level -
 everything can be changed. The visual components of themes are a rich
 set of graphical images in a variety of formats. Theme makers can
 unleash their artistic talents without bounds. Themes are not limited
 to just different colors and background images on the same old desktop.  
 .
 Enlightenment features the BrushedMetal theme, designed by gimp legend,
 tigert. It is predominately grey with the subtle texture of - you
 guessed it - brushed metal.  The menus in particular look superb. The
 sound files for BrushedMetal are in a separate package,
 enlightenment-theme-brushedmetal.
