Description: The Enlightenment Window Manager
 The Enlightenment Window Manager (Developer Release), or "E", whose motto 
 is "Time to rethink everything". It allows complete user control of almost
 every possible setting.  This is  accomplished through its use of themes.
 It now includes support for root menus, iconification, docking, GNOME and
 KDE integration, and much more.
 .
 Enlightenment features the BrushedMetal theme, designed by gimp legend, tigert. 
 It is predominately grey with the subtle texture of - you guessed it - brushed 
 metal.  The menus in particular look superb.
