Description: The Enlightenment Window Manager
 The Enlightnment Window Manager, whose motto is "Time to rethink everything".
 It allows complete user control of almost every possible setting.  This is 
 accomplished through its use of themes.  However at this stage, Enlightenment

 There is no support for menus or iconization.
