Welcome to the Enlightenment FAQ

These docs should not be considered a replacement for the regular documentation
included with Enlightenment.  Read these docs first.  Once you have gotten
Enlightenment running (see INSTALL) you should middle-click on the desktop, and
select the "Help" menu item.  The Enlightenment Help Browser (dox) should
appear.

Q: I can't find my _Iconbox(iconbox) or change its settings.

A: There are two possibilities here.

1. You don't have an Iconbox on your desktop right now. Just middle-click and
select Desktop/Create new iconbox

2. Your Iconbox is transparent and borderless.  Iconify a window and see if
your icon appears.  If so, rightclick on it to reconfigure your Iconbox.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Can't Seem To Find My Left Mouse Menu

A:  Your menu files may be destroyed.  Try rerunning the program that initially
generated them.  First you'll want to remove the ~/.enlightenment/*.menu files.
Rebuild them using the Maintenance menu.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q:  All My Settings Are Mangled And I Can't Fix It

A:  Well, if things get really messed up, you can always remove all of
enlightenment's automatically saved files.  go into ~/.enlightenment, and
remove the ...e_session* files, and then blow away the cached directory.  If
your theme is broken, remove the user_theme.cfg file, also.  The
next time you start enlightenment it should reset everything to the default.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: I Upgraded My Theme, But The New One Isn't Being Used

A: When you upgrade a theme that does not come with enlightenment, when you go
into your ~/.enlightenment/themes directory, be sure to delete the unpacked
directory version of your theme that should be sitting next to the theme, if it
is there.  Otherwise when Enlightenment attempts to start the new version it
will use the old files, which causes this problem.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q:  I set my window to borderless and can't set it back or move it.

A:  ALT + Right mouse button when pressed anywhere in the window will give you
the window operations menu. ALT + Left mouse button will move the
window and ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the window.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How can I move or resize the iconbox.

A: As described above, ALT + Right mouse button will give you the
window operations menu, ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the
iconbox and ALT+left mouse button will move it.

Q: How do I set up Enlightenment to work with GNOME?

A: By default, Enlightenment supports all of the GNOME hints.  However, if you
want to run GMC you may notice that clicking on the root window does not
always have the desired effect (for dragging icons, GMC's root menus, etc).
If you want to use GMC with enlightenment, there are a couple of options.  You
can use alt+leftmouse and alt+rightmouse to use the GMC root menus.  Or, you
can edit the keybindings.cfg file to remove the bindings for your left and
right
mousebuttons.  There is a copy of keybindings.cfg that will do this for you
that comes with enlightenment.  in /path/to/enlightenment/configs/
copy the keybindings.gmc.cfg into your ~/.enlightenment directory.  When you
restart, you will no longer have the left and right mousebuttons bound to
enlightenment.  To modify your system configuration, copy over the
keybindings.cfg file in that directory.  For your convenience, there is a
keybindings.nogmc.cfg in case you want to reverse this change at a later date.

NOTE: you may choose to use virtual areas instead of virtual desktops since
GMC does not handle clicks anywhere on the root window on desktops other than
0.
If you want to start enlightenment from gnome-session, you should use the
gnome control-panel to select the new enlightenment as your window manager.
Warning: Enlightenment is slower when run from a session manager.  You should
opt to run enlightenment and have enlightenment be your session manager
instead of running gnome-session.  You can start "panel" and "gmc" by hand and
have enlightenment relaunch them as the preferred launch method.  To do this,
once you have launched them by hand, alt-rightclick on them, select "Remember"
and then choose "Restart Application on Login".

Q: How do I set up Enlightenment to work with KDE?

A: By default, Enlightenment does not support the KDE hints.  You can turn them
on easily through your settings menus, however.  If you want to add support
automatically upon launch (which can be disabled by the autosaved user
configuration) then copy the control.kde.cfg to the ~/.enlightenment directory
and rename it to control.cfg.  If you are doing this after launching
enlightenment for the first time, you will want to remove the line from your
~/.enlightenment/...e_session.XXXXXX file that looks like: <br>
1366 0
simply remove that line and start up enlightenment again.
If your "KDE Support" _settings(settings) panel still show KDE support
turned on, then
you can simply check the box there, and KDE support will remain on.
You can launch kpanel and/or kfm from your .xsession or .xinitrc files and
they will work correctly.  If you want to edit the startkde script
(system-wide configuration change) find the line that contains kwm and replace
it with /path/to/enlightenment.

Q:  These Docs Didn't Help, Where Can I Get More Help?

A: Well, we obviously can't answer all of your questions just by predicting
them, so I would try the website as well as looking at the
mailing lists , especially the mail archives.  Chances are that someone
else has probably had the same problem that you have.  And if all that still
fails, you might try someone on the irc channel.
