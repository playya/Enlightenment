Welcome to the Enlightenment FAQ

These docs should not be considered a replacement for the regular documentation
included with Enlightenment.  Read these docs first.  Once you have gotten
Enlightenment running (see INSTALL) you should middle-click on the desktop, and
select the "Help" menu item.  The Enlightenment Help Browser (dox) should
appear.

Q: I can't find my _Iconbox(iconbox) or change its settings.

A: There are two possibilities here.

1. You don't have an Iconbox on your desktop right now. Just middle-click and
select Desktop/Create new iconbox

2. Your Iconbox is transparent and borderless.  Iconify a window and see if
your icon appears.  If so, rightclick on it to reconfigure your Iconbox.

Q: Can't Seem To Find My Left Mouse Menu

A:  Your menu files may be destroyed.  Try rerunning the program that initially
generated them.  First you'll want to remove the ~/.enlightenment/*.menu files.
Rebuild them using the Maintenance menu.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q:  All My Settings Are Mangled And I Can't Fix It

A:  Well, if things get really messed up, you can always remove all of
enlightenment's automatically saved files.  go into ~/.enlightenment, and
remove the ...e_session* files, and then blow away the cached directory.  If
your theme is broken, remove the user_theme.cfg file, also.  The
next time you start enlightenment it should reset everything to the default.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: I Upgraded My Theme, But The New One Isn't Being Used

A: When you upgrade a theme that does not come with enlightenment, when you go
into your ~/.enlightenment/themes directory, be sure to delete the unpacked
directory version of your theme that should be sitting next to the theme, if it
is there.  Otherwise when Enlightenment attempts to start the new version it
will use the old files, which causes this problem.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q:  I set my window to borderless and can't set it back or move it.

A:  ALT + Right mouse button when pressed anywhere in the window will give you
the window operations menu. ALT + Left mouse button will move the
window and ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the window.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How can I move or resize the iconbox.

A: As described above, ALT + Right mouse button will give you the
window operations menu, ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the
iconbox and ALT+left mouse button will move it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q:  These Docs Didn't Help, Where Can I Get More Help?

A: Well, we obviously can't answer all of your questions just by predicting
them, so I would try the website as well as looking at the
mailing lists , especially the mail archives.  Chances are that someone
else has probably had the same problem that you have.  And if all that still
fails, you might try someone on the irc channel.
