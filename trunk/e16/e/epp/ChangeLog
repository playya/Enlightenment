I'm on a warning crushing mission.  damn you, llane.  Well, I've STARTED to

if I'm going to let this haunt me for the rest of my days because E has some
crappily written code in it.

Now that we've gone through with -ansi -pedantic and there are no more
warnings, maybe Tru64 support will work in epp?
