With this Epplet you can switch between your Gtk-Themes.
<br>
Switching updates the theme for all Gtk-Apps and starts a little Gtk-App that comes with E-GtkRc to show you the result.
<p>
I wrote this little Epplet because I don't use GNOME just E. So I needed a little tool that would do the same as the Theme-Selector of the GNOME-ControlCenter.

<font face=aircut3/16 color=#88eeff>HowTo use:
<p>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
You must have your .gtkrc-files installed in ~/.gtk/.
<br>
For example to select BlueSteel from the themes-list you should have the file .gtkrc.BlueSteel in ~/.gtk/ which could have it's pixmap-directory in ~/.gtk/ too.<p>
The Epplet just makes symlinks to the gtkrc's so it is very important that you have the right "module_path" and "pixmap_path" definitions in your gtkrc's. module_path is for the different gtk-engines you may use like "pixmap" or "thinice".  pixmap_path tells the gtk-engines where to find the pixmaps used in the gtk-themes.
<p>
When you install new themes you have to press the RELOAD-button between help and close.
