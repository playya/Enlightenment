The Mountbox was designed with the the way Enlightenment's iconbox
works in mind. For every user-mountable device you have in your system, the
Mountbox shows an appropriate icon. You can scroll back and forth
among the montpoints using the arrow buttons. Scrolling wraps around after the
left- and rightmost icons.
<p>
By clicking on the icons with your left mouse button, you can mount and unmount
your filesystems. When a filesystem is unmounted, the icon is displayed in
a translucent manner, when it's mounted, it's fully opaque. You even get a nice,
 smooth fade between the two states for free :)

Right-clicking on the icons will show details about the devices and their
mountpoints, respectively.

You can configure the images for the Mountbox background, the types of devices
that the Mountbox recognizes and icons for these types using the configuration
dialog:
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The default icon defines the icon that is used for all devices that cannot be
matched by one of the patterns (see below). The background image is stretched
behind all the device icons.
<p>
In the "Pattern" and "Image File" entries you can define how the various
devices are shown in the Mountbox window. If the text given as a pattern is
contained in either the device name or its mountpoint, there is a match and
the corresponding image is used. You can browse, add or delete definitions
using the control elements below.
