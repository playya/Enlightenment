Welcome to E-UrlWatcher. This epplet is designed to help you deal with urls.
Less typing, more browsing. There are currently two main features to
E-UrlWatch.
<p>
_Url_Launcher(launcher)
<br>
_Url_Catcher(catcher)

Url Launching.

<p>
Ok. The three buttons: www, ftp, get all run a command (configurable via the
config) on a url in the X paste buffer.  
<p>
Eg. You highlight a url, so it
goes into the paste buffer, and press WWW, and it will be launched by
netscape. You could configure ftp to be gftp instead of netscape, and by
default, get uses wget. So depending on whether you want to see a page,
browse ftp, or download a file, you choose a button.
<p>
_Url_Catcher(catcher)

File Watching.

<p>
The second feature is the url catcher bit. I use TE for IRC, which is a
script running on EPIC. This catches urls from conversations, and sticks
them in ~/.te/.urls
<p>
The epplet watches this file, and when a new url appears, shows a button and
plays a sound, allowing you to launch the url without typing, copying or
pasting. It works really well, someone types hey, go to
www.wherever.com, and the epplet goes "Whoosh" and a button
appears allowing you to go there :) You can even tell it to launch every url
that appears in there, but it is set not to by default.

So. If you load the epplet and close it, you will get a config
file in ~/.enlightenment/epplet_config/E-UrlWatch/E-UrlWatch.cfg

Edit this file to change your prefs. If you don't use TE, any other URL list
can be watched by editing the cfg.
