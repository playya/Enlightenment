fixed Makefile.am in epplets to actually build some directories it asked for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 18 18:13:35 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

fixed another Makefile.am bug

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 19 14:21:41 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Added 7of9 mode to E-Biff just for raster. :-)
Also fixed some bugs with the config file stuff.  If you're going to parse a
config file, *honor* it for pete's sake! =P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 22 21:43:33 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Alright, I've got the config stuff working as planned.  Epplet_Init() has the
same parameters as it used to.  If you use config files, make sure to call
Epplet_load_config() AFTER calling Epplet_Init() but BEFORE attempting to
access config data.

Also note the function name changes:  Epplet_save_config(),
Epplet_query_config_data(), and Epplet_modify_config_data().

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 22 22:48:20 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Multiple instance and config file support for E-Cpu, E-Net, and E-Biff. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 22 23:22:25 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Fixed configure.in so that user-specified $CFLAGS will be honored.  Also
removed all the warnings from compiling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Oct 23 00:15:29 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-MemWatch, a memory/swap monitor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Oct 23 10:03:02 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

Added patch from horms (horms@valinux.com) to allow you to remove popup entries

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Oct 23 21:00:30 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

Second patch from horms about popup entry removal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 24 12:14:07 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Lock files now store PID's so that stale checks can be made.  It seems to
work here, but I'll need lots of testing.

PLEASE remove all .lock files from ~/.enlightenment/epplet_config/*/ and close
all running epplets before running any new ones!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 24 13:05:15 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Added Epplet_query_config_data_with_def().  See the header file for syntax.
For some reason, the compiler didn't like it when I spelled out "default."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 25 16:49:48 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Added a mode for open() since apparently some systems don't default to
(0666 | umask) like they should. :(

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 25 23:28:31 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-Disk, an epplet which gives you a numerical and graphical view of your disk
I/O.  It also keeps persistent bandwidth data, so the longer you run it, the
more accurately the percentage bars will portray your I/O bandwith usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 25 23:43:23 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-NetFlame was too spiffy for me to not add it. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 13:42:53 PDT 1999
(KainX)

First off, I removed some unneeded variables from E-MemWatch.  I also fixed a
reporting bug in E-Disk.

But most importantly, I fixed Epplet_change_label() to avoid changing a label
to the exact same string.  This is the best place to handle this situation,
because it saves resources (we already have both strings to compare) and, due
to the nature of epplets, the probability is very high that this function
would only (or at least primarily) be called from a timer callback.  So it
simplifies client code this way too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 14:15:39 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Fixed E-Time to look better.  Should fix the problem with non-BlueSteel
themes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 16:06:43 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Okay, don't kill me.  I had to change the API again because it was broken.
Epplet_load_config() now takes no parameters.  I also renamed some functions,
which the following command should help you do:

perl -p -i.bak -e \
	's/config_data_with_def/config_def/g; s/_config_data/_config/g;' \
	<files>

That all goes on a single line, BTW.  And replace <files> with the names of
your .c files.  You must now specify any defaults by calling
Epplet_query_config_def() instead and passing the default to that function.

I also added the ability to right-justify label text by specifying a negative
x coordinate.  See E-Time for a sample.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 17:44:38 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-Sys, an uptime epplet that actually *works*. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Oct 28 18:58:52 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Basic cleanups on the config stuff.  I made sure that all epplets using the
config subsystem are using atexit(), and I added the same re-prioritizing
code that my epplets have to E-Cpu and E-NetFlame so they wouldn't be as
CPU-intensive.  E-NetFlame has also been upgraded to v0.3 with bandwidth
patches from Shawn (the author), and it also has a config file option for
which interface to monitor (default "eth0") for those who might want to keep
an eye on ppp0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 31 15:07:43 PST 1999
(Mandrake)

gave gilbertt access to put screenshoot in CVS.  YOU NEED TO MODIFY THE
CHANGELOG THOUGH.  fixed some warnings here and there.  I don't like warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 31 11:36:50 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-ScreenShoot. I guess I should include a recent Changelog:
Added dox help, including a couple of images to make things more clear.
Found several bugs in my drawing routines, and squashed them.
Added a couple of new cloak-animations.
Please let me know if you have problems building it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 31 21:36:50 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

New cloak-animation - text banner.
Fixed my bouncing ball.
Rand()omised my atoms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 1 22:06:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Nothing spectacular:
	Fixed some issues with a couple of cloak-anims
	Added SineWave. Unless I'm feeling wacky sometime, that just about
	does it for cloak-anims. Enough is enough ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 2 18:59:14 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Oh dear. There was something terribly wrong with my starfields. I think
there still is, but it's better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov  2 13:31:28 PST 1999
(KainX)

An update from Matt McClanahan <cardinal@dodds.net> to his previous patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov  2 18:28:36 PST 1999
(KainX)

A new cloak mode for E-ScreenShoot...random!  You can guess what it does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov  3 23:58:36 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

More late-night coding for Tom ;-)
The trouble with using a .1f format string for something which will
accept a < 0.1 value, is that the value is written as 0.
This is clearly not a good idea, and led to an interesting 5 minutes
bug-hunt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov  4 16:00:26 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Slides, a slideshow epplet.  This is just the initial version; more features
coming soon.  :-)

Also some API additions/bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov  4 18:39:32 PST 1999
(KainX)

Several new features for E-Slides and some new icons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov  5 10:44:18 PST 1999
(KainX)

The zoom button works now.  It executes an arbitrary command and replaces an
occurance of %s in the string with the current image filename.  The default
is "ee %s".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov  5 16:36:55 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Xss, an xscreensaver epplet.  Unfortunately, xscreensaver crashes my X
server on a regular basis, so I'll have to continue development for this at
home.  It currently has...issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov  6 12:03:16 PST 1999
(KainX)

Well, it seems to work pretty well at this point.  Now I just need to figure
out how to support multiple hacks (which is what those previous/next buttons
are for).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov  8 14:05:56 PST 1999
(KainX)

Multiple hacks are now supported in E-Xss.  Just edit your config file and
list as many hacks as you want.  The key values are "hack_0", "hack_1", etc.,
on up to however many hacks you want.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov  8 20:32:49 PST 1999
(KainX)

Raised the delay for qix (oops) and redid the date format in E-Time.  It now
shows the full weekday name and shows the day before the month.  I also added
a space for improved readability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov  9 23:31:01 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added some more goofy text to the banner cloak-animation, tidied up some
bits and bobs... I forget what else ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 19:13:17 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-Mixer. Probably b0rked the configure.in and Makefile.am, but it
compiles on my box (tm).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 19:48:22 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-SD. I don't think I screwed anything up in the process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 14:54:28 PST 1999
(Mandrake)

removed EppletTest and EppletConfigTest from install procedure.  no need for
those to be automagically installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 15:49:40 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Mountbox is now size-matched with everything else, and the help/config/close
buttons appear and disappear just like the other epplets.  Consistency is a
good thing. :-)  Also, E-Xss won't show/hide the drawing area any more when
it gains/loses focus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 20:49:04 PST 1999
(KainX)

Oh my goodness.  This should resolve all the textbox silliness.  (At least all
that I've run across so far....)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 18:50:07 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

*Hopes KainX doesn't kill him*

Fixed a couple of things.
o No longer tries to open subdirectories as images (my
.enlightenment/backgrounds directory contains only two subdirs, tiled and
fullscreen, previously it dumped core trying to open these as images).
o If there are no images in the dir, the Epplet_dialog_ok was never shown,
as it was followed by an exit(-1). It must be followed (at some point) by
Epplet_loop() to work.

KainX: If I broke it, you can kill me :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 11:55:02 PST 1999
(KainX)

Okay, I've fixed the API issue with Epplet_modify_config(), and I've fixed the
weird Epplet_reset_textbox() behavior.  (For the record, there was never a
buffer overflow here.  The textbox contents are dynamically allocated and
resized.)

I also tweaked some of Tom's changes both for style and more robustness.  I
also fixed the OK dialog error the "right" way.  The real problem was not
calling Esync() before exiting. :-)

Now if only I could talk Tom into putting a newline at the end of his
ChangeLog entries.... ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 21:08:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changed ~/ to $HOME/ in the default E-ScreenShoot directory config, for
those people with strange obscure machines that just don't play ball :-P

Oh, and just for KainX, there follows TWO newlines. One for this entry, and
one to make up for the last omission. ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 20:04:39 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to epplets/E-Exec.c 

Added some buttons to E-Exec for later use in controlling the history feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 20:19:09 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to epplets/E-Exec.c 

Added some code to do a command history. A change to the api is needed for it
to work, so I'm committing this first so I don't screw anything up during the
api modification. currently the relevant code is commented out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 22:59:14 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to epplets/E-Exec.c api/epplet.c api/epplet.h

Ok. E-Exec now does command history of up to 15 items. Added
Epplet_change_textbox. Not thoroughly tested, but isn't that what users 
are for? *runs*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 00:50:41 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to api/eppet.c

Textboxes can scroll now. It's a little weird cuz the right "limit" moves 
around. I need to fix the way it figures out where to stop spitting out
chars since upper/lowercase chars are not all the same width. I'll look into
it unless someone has some insight on this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 16:50:11 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to E-Clock.c E-Areas.c Emix.x E-Sys.c E-Mountbox.c E-Load.c
E-Memwatch.c

Using atexit(Epplet_cleanup) prevents all those "mulitple spawning on
startup problems" people get.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:02:56 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Changed some stuff in E-Exec (thanks Ian), to make it safer and fun for all ages. Also hopefully
fixed a potential bug in Epplet_change_config (same one Epplet_modify_config used to have).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:17:34 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Changed epplets/E-Exec.c

Added Epplet_unremember to cb_close.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:41:29 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added a feature to allow you to scroll off the end of the command history and 
back into a blank textbox. Was supposed to already be in, but for some reason 
it didn't work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:55:48 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Gee..wonder how many more commits I can get before 14:00...
Fixed a segfault bug in E-Exec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 19:14:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to E-SD.[ch]

I'm hoping to have fixed the occasional high cpu usage my epplet seems to
show for everyone except me...

Please let me know if it worked...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 19:14:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

More E-SD.c changes. Should be better, but let me know if any lag occurs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 12:35:49 PST 1999
(KainX)

Cleaning up the epplets is becoming a morning routine for me.... =P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 15:37:46 PST 1999
(KainX)

Some UI changes to make E-Exec a little more friendly. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 15:57:40 PST 1999
(KainX)

Wrap-around history.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 13 00:34:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Thanks to code from Steve Brunton <brunton@dweeb.turner.com>, E-Mixer should
now support IRIX. Please test this for me you funny hardware people you ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 13 21:03:02 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to : E-ScreenShoot.[ch] clock.[ch]

Renamed "Rotator" to "Mesh", and added new cloak-animation, "Funky Mesh"

I was bored. Ok?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 00:33:11 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-ScreenSave. Will control xscreensaver, but currently just locks the
screen on demand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 01:34:43 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Should have quashed all lag in E-SD. Please let me know

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 02:24:13 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added new animation to E-SD, called history, it is responsive to sound, and
will hopefully keep StriderZ off my back for a day or two :P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 02:53:54 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added another animation to E-SD, "History Bar", its cooler.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 15 12:30:13 PST 1999
(KainX)

Another morning, another cleanup.  Doesn't anyone use warning flags besides
me?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 16 17:10:44 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added a textbox cursor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 17 14:18:42 PST 1999
(KainX)

Cleanups to the libgtop stuff.  Someone (Mark) please tell me if this doesn't
work on Solaris....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 17 21:46:41 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Made most of the functions in epplets/cloak.c non-static so that they can be 
accessed by other epplets. Also Added E-NetGraph, a wmnet wannabe epplet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 18 11:57:17 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Ok, added the *real* E-NetGraph to cvs. Coded by Daniel Erat 
(http://www2.ucsc.edu/~erat/). I had no idea this existed, it rocks. It takes 
hella command-line options, but I modified it to use a config file too. It may 
not run at first if your net device is not ppp0 and you don't specify. This 
will be changed. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 18 18:16:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Working towards cool new E-ScreenShoot features.

They're not there yet though :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 18 18:42:45 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to cloak.[ch]

If those functions are not going to be static any more, declare them in
cloak.h, so other epplets can use them

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 18 19:15:14 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to E-ScreenShoot

Added a couple of new config options. They're in the dox, but I'll yip about
them too.

VIEW_SHOT & VIEWER   -   View shot after taking it using VIEWER (ee default)
RUN_SCRIPT & SCRIPT_TO_RUN  -  Run script/program after taking shot, sending
filename as parameter.

Also cleaned up some of that code, it was hairy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 18 19:42:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to E-NetGraph.c

Removed some warnings which show up when compiling with -Wall.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 19 12:35:48 PST 1999
(KainX)

Okay, all the conditional build stuff should be fixed up now.  I'll need some
SGI people to test this as well as Solaris people, since it's entirely
possible I borked them both. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 19 17:49:09 PST 1999
(KainX)

Fixes and cleanups to E-NetGraph.  It now does config files properly and
includes all the options in them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 20 19:55:22 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changed the Makefile.am to put epplet images in $EROOT/epplet_data.

I wanted to have epplet subdirs under this directory, but it really
complicated the Makefile, so I left it for now. It was easy for me the make
the changes with sed this way too ;)

Any stuff your app needs to install should go in epplet_data, preferably
with the filename prefixed with the name of your epplet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 20 16:17:49 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Update debian/rules to put stuff in epplet_data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 20 16:30:02 EST 1999
(StriderZ

Adding E-MoonClock by mazeone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 20 21:56:32 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Fixed some warnings in Moon.c, changed <epplet.h> to "epplet.h" in
E-MoonClock.c, fixed problem with blank_epplet in my cloak stuff.
Can't remember what else.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 20 18:00:11 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added a popup command history to E-Exec and made it wider.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 21 12:28:37 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

epplet.h wasn't getting installed.

(wtf?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 21 22:15:01 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added a button to E-Slides to set E's bg.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 22 00:51:00 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added an option to E-Slides config to change root bg when image changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 23 11:03:39 PST 1999
(KainX)

Fixed a seg fault bug in E-Slides.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 23 21:32:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

I am such a dufus.

Changed my epplets to actually save their config when you finish your X
session, instead of only when you click the close button.

How did I let this go unfixed???

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 23 22:30:44 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Whee! Say hello to E-UrlWatch.epplet.

This is a url-launcher, which will do a few cool things. Currently, it
launches urls using the X paste buffer. The idea is that you are on irc, or
reading an email, and see a url, you select the text, press the "Paste"
button on the epplet, and the url is launched. The command to launch the
url is defined in the config.

The epplet will parse the text, so you can grab a load of text, and it'll
find and launch the embedded url.

It'll also clean up naughty chars, but I have more to do here.

The next step is the "watching" part. The epplet will watch a text file (or
several) containing a list of urls, and will flash when a new one is added.
Clicking the (not yet existing) launch button will launch this url. The idea
is for apps like TE which use a url list ~/.te/.urls. So you're in irc,
someone gives you a url, and the epplet flashes and lets you launch it, no
typing.

Also, (once I code it), the epplet will record all urls you launch through 
it in a text file. In a later version, this list will be emailed to your mom
on a weekly basis
;)

Obviously, this thing has the cloaking stuff, as I just copy and paste it
these days :)

Its an early beta, so bear with me while I rapidly add features :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 23 23:26:47 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Now save all urls processed to ~/.Urls

Auto e-mailing to your mom is not yet supported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 24 18:29:19 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

E-UrlWatch.

Changed size. Added buttons to allow several different "modes" of action.
When you have a url in the X paste buffer, each button will grab the url,
and perform a configurable action upon it. The three are www, ftp, and get.
The default is gnome-moz-remote for the first two, and wget for the third.
The epplet is extremely ugly right now, but I'm working on the code atm, so
ignore that :)

More cool stuff to come :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 24 20:11:57 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

E-UrlWatch.

Now displays the url it launches, and scrolls long urls back and forth, so
you can see 'em.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 24 12:11:04 PST 1999
(KainX)

Added checks for epplet image classes on startup.  Adapted from a patch by
Troy Pesola <troy.pesola@network.com>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 24 18:33:45 PST 1999
(KainX)

Major restructuring and cleanup.  I think the new standard should be pretty
self-explanatory, but let me know if you have any questions.  CVS developers,
PLEASE read epplets/Makefile.am carefully to see how it all works now.

Icons are stored in epplets/icons/ and are installed into
$EROOT/epplet_icons/.  All miscellaneous data files (including images) are
stored in epplets/<epplet name>-data/ and are installed into
$EROOT/epplet_data/<epplet name>/.  Also note that, if you're going to use the
same old aircut3.ttf and bg.png in your help section, add your epplet's name
to NEED_BG and NEED_FONT in epplets/Makefile.am.  Do NOT commit duplicates of
those two files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 25 20:48:51 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Oops. Fixed a naughty segfault with my shoddy string handling routines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 25 19:17:05 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

E-UrlWatch

Added support for URL grabbers such as that found in TE/Epic. In the example
of TE, urls are stripped from irc convo, and dumped into ~/.te/.urls
If told to via the config (as it will by default), E-UrlWatch will watch
that file, and will strip out new urls and allow you to view them at the
touch of a button. (Or automatically if you specify). It'll also perform a
configurable command (I use it to play a sound) when a new URL appears.

Other misc cleanups have taken place, and I have very carefully hidden a
couple of juicy bugs. Find them for me, and you win a prize ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a groovy new noise for E-UrlWatch to make when a new URL is found.
Coolness. Now supports TE ootb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can paste to textboxes now....whoopty d00.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Textbox bugfixes (I hope), thanks for bitching, guys *ducks*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 28 01:12:11 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added some help dox for E-UrlWatch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 28 20:04:45 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Fixed some overzealous free()ing (no checks) in Epplet_gadget_destroy()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 28 21:06:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added a popup containing a history of the urls you launch, of the urls found
in the file being watched. This is cool :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 28 21:52:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Made the screensaver lock command configurable in E-ScreenSave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 29 01:08:58 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Hrm. A segfault with a certain form of url. Fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make focusing between an epplet and it's gadget's work a little better. Basically added sloppy-focus. The epplet remembers which gadget last had focus and, if none currently have focus and the last_gadget was a textboxes, passes key events to it. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 28 21:05:11 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Change to something more like ClickToFocus. The gadgets won't *keep* the focus
unless you click them. This probably needs a little more work...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 28 21:33:53 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

More fun with focus...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 29 14:08:10 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Tidied up E-UrlWatch lots. Its pretty lean now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 29 16:03:53 PST 1999
(KainX)

Added support for specifying the width and height (in epplet units, 16 pixels)
of the E-Slides window.  -w <width> and -h <height> are the options.  The
default is the traditional 3x3, of course.  Note that this cannot be done via
config file options since the size is set before the config loader can be
called.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 29 17:08:23 PST 1999
(KainX)

This fixes the bug E-Slides demonstrated in the focus stuff.  Doesn't seem to
break anything else as far as I can tell....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 29 19:03:00 PST 1999
(KainX)

Applied and modified significantly a patch to support E-NetFlame on Solaris.  Thanks to Tomas Calvo Gomez <tcalvo@tid.es> and Mark Bowyer <Moredhel@earthling.net> for supplying the Solaris-isms. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 29 20:34:40 PST 1999
(KainX)

All the network stats stuff has been moved to a centralized location, and all
the network stats epplets have been converted to use the new functions.  Thus,
all network epplets can now have a portable interface to the data without
having to worry about portability; the backend takes care of it.

I also added copyright statements and a license to all my epplets.  And I
removed my name from the E-Mountbox copyright since my contributions were
negligible. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 30 17:48:31 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

E-ScreenShoot.c E-SD.c E-ScreenSave.c

Urm. Should've done this before. Removed some duplication, and one omission
in my cloaking code. Silly really, most people won't notice any difference,
but I will :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Dec 01 23:05:13 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

api changes.

Ok. I have added some functions to the api, they are not yet perfect, but
they compile cleanly and don't create any problems. Don't use them yet
though, the api may change.

Window Epplet_create_window(int w,int h,int x,int y,char *title);
void Epplet_window_show(Window win);
void Epplet_window_hide(Window win);
void Epplet_window_destroy(Window win);
void Epplet_window_switch_context(Window newwin);
void Epplet_window_reset_context(void);

All of these functions are in place and work. I have yet to add code to
handle delete_events. At the moment, if you close the dialog window, the
epplet exits. This is clearly not intended ;) I'll fix it tomorrow, its late
here now.

You can even switch context and add widgets to your new window with no
problems ;)

Other things to fix tomorrow is the event handling stuff which assumes only
one window will be around...

I am currently using E-ScreenSave as my test epplet for this code, as I know
only about 2 people use it ;) Try it to see the code working.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Dec  1 19:11:13 PST 1999
(KainX)

For one thing, I think I've fixed the seg fault in E-MoonClock.  Here's
hoping.

I also added the background setting functionality to E-Slides, but this time
it was done *right*. :-)  Take a look and see for yourself.  If you look at
the code, it also demonstrates how to use E IPC to set backgrounds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Dec 02 23:07:45 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Ok. More config window stuff.

Fun fun. I had to create a new type, Epplet_window to hold some window info,
and a stack to push and pop contexts for adding gadgets to different new
windows. This stuff works real well, and I am chuffed with it :)

The extra windows now redraw themselves on exposes, and new gadgets can be
added to them successfully. W00p.

I had to implement some new stuff, so please check nothing is broke (I am
not finished, but I don't want to commit code that breaks stuff).

Here are some details on the new stuff :)

---------------
PUBLIC STUFF

typedef struct epplet_window
{
    Window win;
    int w;
    int h;
    Pixmap bg_pmap;
    Pixmap bg_mask;
    Pixmap bg_bg;
}EppWindow;
typedef EppWindow *Epplet_window;

Epplet_window Epplet_create_window(int w,int h,int x,int y,char *title);
void Epplet_window_show(Epplet_window win);
void Epplet_window_hide(Epplet_window win);
void Epplet_window_destroy(Epplet_window win);
void Epplet_window_push_context(Epplet_window newwin);
Epplet_window Epplet_window_pop_context(void);
---------------
PRIVATE STUFF

static Epplet_window context_win;       /* Current context win */
static int          window_stack_pos;   /* For context changes */
static Epplet_window window_stack[20];  /* For context changes */
static Epplet_window mainwin;           /* Always the main epplet window */

static int          window_num = 0;     /* For window list */
static Epplet_window *windows = NULL;   /* List of windows to loop though */

/* For Keeping a list of windows owned by the epplet, to loop through and
 * do stuff with. */
static void         Epplet_register_window(Epplet_window win);
static void         Epplet_unregister_window(Epplet_window win);

/* Redraw all epplet windows (excluding the main epplet window) */
static void         Epplet_draw_windows(void);
/* Redraw window win */
static void         Epplet_draw_window(Epplet_window win);

/* Refresh window backgrounds on theme change */
static void Epplet_refresh_backgrounds(void);

-------------
I also added an item to GadGeneral so that I can find what window a gadget
was created on:

typedef struct gad_general
{
   GadType             type;
   char                visible;
   Epplet_window       parent;
}  
GadGeneral;

-------------

Not to mention the reworking of code which draws or handles windows.

I have more tinkering to do in the event handling, to catch delete_events,
and to filter out mouseovers etc for separate windows. Tomorrow :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 03 17:20:15 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

More config window stuff. Fixed a memleak, and now destroying an
Epplet_window also destroys any child gadgets attached to the window. I
think this works better, let me know otherwise.

I also cleaned up a couple of things, fixed adding buttons to new windows,
and improved the test epplet to be a better demo (E-ScreenSave right now).

I removed the Epplet_draw_window* functions, 'cos I don't need them :) What
I actually needed to do was fix Epplet_draw_image - so I have :)

Lots more to do tonight :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 03 18:34:47 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Hrm. Bye bye hardcoding, hello malloc()ed context stack. Improved the test
app further.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 03 19:25:16 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

*cough*
Should prolly free the background pixmaps when I destroy a window, right?
Thought so.
I was wondering where all my memory was going...
;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 03 20:11:23 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Right. You can now specify a "vertical" property for your new window. Works
the same as the vertical parameter in Epplet_init. Uses the same
imageclasses too.

I had a big headache debugging this, it just didn't seem to work, I knew
BrushedMetal (the theme I use) had a different (green) vertical pixmap, but
the windows always came up grey. Just when I was about to go mental, I found
this in epplet.cfg:

__ICLASS __BGN
  __NAME EPPLET_BACKGROUND_HORIZONTAL
  __NORMAL "epplets/images/bg.png"
  __EDGE_SCALING   2 2 2 2
__END

__ICLASS __BGN
  __NAME EPPLET_BACKGROUND_VERTICAL
  __NORMAL "epplets/images/bg.png"
  __EDGE_SCALING   2 2 2 2
__END

Gah. No wonder the images weren't changing!

Is there a reason for this? If not, could it be changed to:

__ICLASS __BGN
  __NAME EPPLET_BACKGROUND_HORIZONTAL
  __NORMAL "epplets/images/bg.png"
  __EDGE_SCALING   2 2 2 2
__END

__ICLASS __BGN
  __NAME EPPLET_BACKGROUND_VERTICAL
  __NORMAL "epplets/images/bg_v.png"
  __EDGE_SCALING   2 2 2 2
__END

Please?

Anyway, the vertical stuff works now, and probably did an hour ago, before I
went off chasing nonexistant bugs :)

I also tidied up some other stuff, and killed another global :)

See E-ScreenSave in cvs for an example, press the "lock" button to see it in
action :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 03 20:22:56 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Removed the int x, and int y properties for Epplet_create_window, as they
were pretty pointless, and I hate it when windows decide where they should
go ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 03 23:47:45 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Okay. Lots has changed. It was pretty inconsistant to have loads of
functions returning or requiring a "Window win" paramater, and mine dealing
with "Epplet_window" parameters. I had to lose one, so I lost the one which
caused no breakage. Mine :)

I still use Epplet_window internally to encapsulate data on a per-window
basis. However, all public functions deal with "Window win" again. Now
things are consistant. The Epplet_window type is now private and hidden.

To do this, I have implemented a little lookup function to relate
Epplet_windows to Windows, which should be more than adequate for our needs.

You can now declare a delete event handler for your whole epplet, although I
may change to per-window delete event handlers if people request it.

If you return 1 from the delete event handler, or don't supply one, or
supply NULL, the window will be destroyed for you, if you return 0, the
delete event will be ignored. Use this to do things like saying "hrm, those
two settings cannot coexist" or "that file does not exist" etc.

I'm nearly finished with the window functions now, and will next add
convenience wrappers such as Epplet_create_window_config(...) to add ok,
apply and save buttons and setup callbacks for you, and some other stuff
too.

I'd appreciate it if people would poke around and see what they think, I'm
new at this Xlib stuf...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 04 01:05:38 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

So, say hello to Epplet_create_window_config.

It rules.

Here's the definition:

Window Epplet_create_window_config(int w,int h,char *title,
         void (*ok_func) (void *data),void *ok_data,
         void (*apply_func) (void *data),void *apply_data,
         void (*cancel_func) (void *data),void *cancel_data);

You can picture what it does, and check it out in E-ScreenSave. (Press the
"Lock" button).

The cool thing is that if you supply NULL for any of the callbacks, that
button won't be added to the dialog. So, for an Ok, Cancel dialog, just
supply NULL for apply_func.

I have added explanation to the epplet.h file, and would like people to bang
at this now? I will set my epplets up to use the new functions fully over
the weekend. This will help me find any problems, as I haven't tested adding
every type of gadget to config windows yet, there may still be redraw issues
I missed.

Its pretty nice now though, and I have checked for memory leaks and bad
handling, please point out anything dubious you see. The api will become
more rich over the next few days, then it should stabilise.

Any feature suggestions, send 'em now :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 04 12:38:14 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Okay. E-ScreenSave now has a working config window which actually changes
the things config! Its really basic, 'cos the epplet is really basic, but it
works. Press the configure button to see it :)

It has working Ok, Apply and Cancel buttons, try them and see. There is
always a dilemna over how stuff like this should work, but in my epplets at
least, cancel undoes everything you changed since opening the window, even
stuff you "apply"ed. See it for yourself, it was really easy to do ;)

Hey StriderZ, there's a textbox on there too :) I'll be talking to you later
about that =P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 04 16:59:29 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added config dialog to E-ScreenShoot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 04 22:46:57 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added some less complex button functions, left the old one in place, so as
not to break anyone's lovely epplets :)

Here's what you got:

/* A cut down version for text-only buttons */
Epplet_gadget   Epplet_create_text_button(char *label, int x, int y,
                                     int w, int h,
                                     void (*func) (void *data), void *data);
/* A cut down version for stdimage-only buttons */
Epplet_gadget   Epplet_create_std_button(char *std, int x, int y,
                                     int w, int h,
                                     void (*func) (void *data), void *data);

Those window things in the original one should really be buried in the api,
and not public, but I won't break anyone's code. There ya go :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 04 22:59:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Oops. Make that:

/* A cut down version for text-only buttons */
Epplet_gadget   Epplet_create_text_button(char *label, int x, int y,
                                     int w, int h,
                                     void (*func) (void *data), void *data);

/* A cut down version for stdimage-only buttons */
Epplet_gadget   Epplet_create_std_button(char *std, int x, int y,
                                     void (*func) (void *data), void *data);

STD images do not need w or h parameters.

=P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 04 23:02:13 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

By popular demand:

/* A cut down version for image-only buttons */
Epplet_gadget   Epplet_create_image_button(char *image, int x, int y,
                                     int w, int h,
                                     void (*func) (void *data), void *data);

That's the last of them! No more =P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Dec 05 19:02:45 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added config dialog to E-Urlwatch, it is much more useable now :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patches to E-MoonClock from Valdis Kletnieks <valdis.kletnieks@vt.edu>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec  6 14:31:34 PST 1999
(KainX)

Applied Tom's patch to E-Slides to support maintaining the aspect ratio when
displaying images in the epplet window.  Also cleaned up the E-MoonClock code
and set the buffer size to 1024 so that everyone will hush. =)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec  6 14:46:15 PST 1999
(KainX)

Sorry folks, forgot this part.  My bad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec  6 20:18:45 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Slides now has a full-featured working config dialog.  Damn good work, Tom.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec  6 21:48:52 PST 1999
(KainX)

Dialog for E-Biff too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec  6 23:07:32 PST 1999
(KainX)

And one for E-Xss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec  7 17:13:06 PST 1999
(KainX)

New dialog for E-NetGraph.  This is the only network epplet I use, so I don't
have any plans to add similar interfaces to the other net epplets, but I
recommend that *someone* does so.

Also, I modified E-Slides and E-NetGraph so that if the config file or the
default settings don't provide a valid image directory (for E-Slides) or a
valid network interface (E-NetGraph), rather than immediately exiting, you
will be presented with the config dialog.  Very handy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec  7 18:02:22 PST 1999
(KainX)

Fixed a seg fault in E-Mountbox if the images in the config file aren't found.
It first falls back on the compiled-in defaults, and if that doesn't work
either, it exits with an error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec  7 20:02:09 PST 1999
(KainX)

Config file support and a new config dialog for E-Time.  You can set the
strings passed to strftime() for each line, and you can also set the text
justification (right or left).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Dec  8 15:41:25 PST 1999
(KainX)

Applied a patch from Michael Roberts <m.t.roberts@student.murdoch.edu.au> so
that invisible gadgets won't try to redraw themselves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Dec  9 14:29:50 EST 1999
(Christian)

The Mountbox reacts to left and right cursor keys now. Also added a Jazz drive
image for piercer <piercer13@home.com>. Config dialog coming soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Dec 09 20:49:42 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Hrm. If nobody minds... I've added:

Window Epplet_create_window_borderless(int w,int h,char *title, char vertical);

In case anyone fancies a borderless window. Or two. For displaying things. In
windows. Without borders. For whatever reason. Erm. I'll stop now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E-Magic.  The 8-ball kind.  Customizeable answers and a cool GIMP-rendered
original graphic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 10 18:28:12 GMT 1999

Changed the epplet window classname to epplet-window (was epplet-config
(oops))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 10 16:15:51 EST 1999

Make E-Exec not add blanks to drop-down list...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Dec 10 21:04:38 EST 1999

Make textbox scroll better...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(gilbertt)

Commands to view urls in E-UrlWatch are now of the format:
command %s
Where %s is substituted with the url.
Eg. The default is now:
gnome-moz-remote --newwin "%s" &
But things like
netscape -remote openURL(%s)
will now work.

That's a really bad habit of mine :( Thanks to Matthew Crites
<mcrites@primenet.com> for pointing it out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 11 13:27:54 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Urm. I don't know if this was intended, but E-Slides never actually
Epplet_gadget_show()'s its image... Don't know when this happened...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Dec 11 17:47:32 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Don't try to open "/dev/null" as an image either.

Prevents those:

IMLIB ERROR: Cannot load image: /dev/null
All fallbacks failed.

messages. I have just used a NULL parameter instead, which I believe is
correct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Dec 12 16:33:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

E-Time wasn't saving its justification setting. Fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editing support for textboxes is bad^H^H^Hgoood....mmmmkay?

Still a little quirky, but I figured it was good enough to commit for now...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec 13 10:19:45 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Textbox editing slightly less quirky...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec 13 09:54:54 PST 1999
(KainX)

This should fix the seg fault people have been seeing.  I also removed an
Esnprintf() and put the sprintf() back; that was a wrong replacement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Textbox editing...

Added querying for multiple configs. If you have a group of configuration
settings that you want to refer to under the same key (e.g. the apps that
a launcher starts up etc), use

void Epplet_modify_multi_config(char *key, char **values, int num);

And if you want to query for a group of settings, use this:

char **Epplet_query_multi_config(char *key, int *num);

Note that you have to free() the returned array here. The key is internally
encoded into __key__1 for the first string, __key__2 for the second etc.

I put some testing code for this into ConfigTestEpplet.c The epplet will
remember all the command line parameters you give on startup and dump
them.
	
Also extended E-Mountbox so that the users can now define the patterns
in the device or mountpoint and corresponding icons themselves. Currently
still via the config file, but the dialog is there. Not functional yet,
though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Dec 13 16:51:48 PST 1999
(KainX)

Added labels for E-MemWatch and E-Disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec 14 15:21:52 PST 1999

StriderZ and I added E-PlayCD as a conditional build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec 14 21:00:41 EST 1999

Fixing up E-PlayCD docs a little...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Textbox editing fixes...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec 14 22:32:51 EST 1999

More textbox editing fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dammit.  My Linux version checking was broken in net.c, so users of 2.1 and
2.2 kernels weren't getting outgoing packet counts.  Fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Dec 16 19:56:24 PST 1999
(KainX)

API changes here, all in order to make E-Disk and E-MemWatch be able to toggle
between the old arrangement and the new.  So basically, you can now move
gadgets to new locations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a destructor for RGB_buf's. From epplet.h:

/* free an RGB buffer */
void            Epplet_free_rgb_buf(RGB_buf buf);

I think the user shouldn't have to think about the internals of an RGB_buf
in order to free it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More work on the Mountbox. Changing backgrounds and default icons should
work on runtime now, modifying and adding mountpoint types too. Deleting
still needs to be done. Oh, and untested, btw.

Damn. I'm getting sick.

Textboxes can now be hidden.

More E-Mountbox stuff. Config dialog now changes dynamically, depending
on whether you have patterns for mathching mountpoint types or not.
Deleting of mountpoint types should work. Still needs more debugging...

No, this is version 0.5, not 0.6, Tom.

Final preparations for the release of 0.5.

Am I too late for 0.5?

Just cleaning up the help a bit. Sorry about the version thing btw, I guess
I have a thing for the number 6 or something?

:)

Okay. I'm trying to make epplets gnome-session friendly (dunno why =P).

People complain about the automatic respawning, so I have added a configure
option --disable-auto-respawn to prevent epplets remembering to restart
(they still remember location, sticky etc).

*I have not tested this* because I refuse to run gnome-session on this box,
but I see no reason why it shouldn't be ok.

Oops. Fixed a long standing bug in E-Urlwatch. Noone uses the ftp or get
buttons obviously ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Jan 14 21:36:41 CST 2000 (thebard)

The beginnings of the OpenGL support is in. Use it, build cool stuff. Mail
me at wmilas@rarcoa.com if something breaks or you want something
implemented

If we run out of images, don't just sit and spin like an idiot.  Tell the user
there's a problem and let them fix it.

Cleaned up more of the Demo code. Tried to track down the case where
Orthogonal projection is getting mapped 2 pixel up and to the right
in the viewport. Cant figure out why its happening. For now im just
adjusting the viewport 2 pixels down and left. Oh, also notice the
pretty colors on teh square. I PROMISE I'll put something more interesting
to look at in in a day or two. :P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Argh. Finally got bugged by E-Exec's size not tesselating properly, and so I
added a --proper-size commandline option to fix that right up =)

Sorry StriderZ ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a config popup that lets you toggle between a flat rotating colored square and a rotating 3d purple cube. Anyone ahve any suggestions for any
E textures i could slap on the sides?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Jan 23 17:30:27 CST 2000

Added saving for configurations. Also started to add lighting. As you can see, its going horribly wrong right now. I'll fix it as soon as i can.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Jan 23 20:44:15 CST 2000
(thebard)

New popup for lighting. Turn it on or off, ect. Only works for the cube, and it still doesnt work correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Jan 24 22:43:58 CST 2000
(thebard)

Well, I broke alot of stuff in the Demo. The important part is that the
light mapped cube works. I need to totally redo the api interface to
enable the correct stecil, depth, and accumulation minimums.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Jan 25 11:06:08 CST 2000
(thebard)

Ok, the Demo now works corretly. Lighting works on the cube but NOT on the
square. The square doesnt have and back face normals and i really dont want
to set any up, since its just supposed to show how to draw a simple non
lighted polygon with colors. Next task is to solidify the glx epplet epi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Jan 25 15:07:32 CST 2000
(thebard)

Altered the api so that you can define ALL the nitty gritty GLX stuf like
accumulation buffers for red, green, blue, alpha channels, depth buffers,
stencil buffers, ect. I'll Add default easier to use calls next.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Jan 25 15:55:11 CST 2000
(thebard)

Added Epplet_default_bind_GL, a quick and dirty default binding for people
to use if the new Epplet_bind_double_GL confuses the hell out of em and they
dont need Epplet_bind_double_GL various buffer settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Jan 27 15:10:15 CST 2000
(thebard)

Added basic texture mapping for the cube. It does not take lighting into
effect, and the damn texture is pixilating as it spins, but it works :P I'll
fix the pixilating and add light and alpha blending in in a bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Jan 27 20:13:06 CST 2000
(thebard)

Fixed the pixilating problem. Im not using mipmaps cause i dont feel like
spending the time. deal with it. :P I am seperating out the specular light
so we get nice lighting and material properties with the texture. Yeah. The
effect fails with Invalid value to GLX_lightmodel_size on my box when running
in GLX hardware. It runs fine and looks nice in software MESA. I'm gonna
spend some time tracking down the glx bug. Not much else to do in this epplet,
It pretty much demos all the stuff i wanted to show. Go out and build
3D spinning load meters and stuff now!

Epplet-side fix for the "millions of remember requests" bug.
I'll implement a better fix when I add a new ipc call to e :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Feb 27 14:52:36 GMT 2000
(gilbertt)

Okay. E has the new ipc call. However, because epplets can't demand that
people have e > 0.16.4, the old behaviour is the default. Please ./configure
--enable-new-remember to test the new behaviour. (You'll need cvs e as of 2
seconds ago) It should be much streamlined. Especially for you guys on
interesting hardware =)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed Epplet_register_event_handler, prompted by email from Alexandre David
<adavid@DoCS.UU.SE>. His patch was incorrect though, and the proper fix is
to change the line where the event handler is called. (His patch changed
only one definition of it, in the wrong place, and broke epplets ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added the first revision of E-Toolbox, a much-needed toolbar epplet.  It's
got a lot already, but there's much more to come.  And unlike certain other
toolbar-type epplets, this one will be done properly and cleanly. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Apr 24 20:19:34 PDT 2000
(KainX)

E-Toolbox can now auto-resize itself like it should.  I also got standard
buttons working in addition to labels and images.  The default setup is now
prettier as well.  I also included another sample config file to give you an
idea of the flexibility it supports.  And there's more to come, of course.
