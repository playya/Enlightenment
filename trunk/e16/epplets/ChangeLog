fixed Makefile.am in epplets to actually build some directories it asked for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 18 18:13:35 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

fixed another Makefile.am bug

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 19 14:21:41 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Added 7of9 mode to E-Biff just for raster. :-)
Also fixed some bugs with the config file stuff.  If you're going to parse a
config file, *honor* it for pete's sake! =P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 22 21:43:33 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Alright, I've got the config stuff working as planned.  Epplet_Init() has the
same parameters as it used to.  If you use config files, make sure to call
Epplet_load_config() AFTER calling Epplet_Init() but BEFORE attempting to
access config data.

Also note the function name changes:  Epplet_save_config(),
Epplet_query_config_data(), and Epplet_modify_config_data().

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 22 22:48:20 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Multiple instance and config file support for E-Cpu, E-Net, and E-Biff. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Oct 22 23:22:25 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Fixed configure.in so that user-specified $CFLAGS will be honored.  Also
removed all the warnings from compiling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Oct 23 00:15:29 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-MemWatch, a memory/swap monitor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Oct 23 10:03:02 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

Added patch from horms (horms@valinux.com) to allow you to remove popup entries

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Oct 23 21:00:30 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

Second patch from horms about popup entry removal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 24 12:14:07 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Lock files now store PID's so that stale checks can be made.  It seems to
work here, but I'll need lots of testing.

PLEASE remove all .lock files from ~/.enlightenment/epplet_config/*/ and close
all running epplets before running any new ones!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 24 13:05:15 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Added Epplet_query_config_data_with_def().  See the header file for syntax.
For some reason, the compiler didn't like it when I spelled out "default."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 25 16:49:48 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Added a mode for open() since apparently some systems don't default to
(0666 | umask) like they should. :(

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(KainX)

E-Disk, an epplet which gives you a numerical and graphical view of your disk
I/O.  It also keeps persistent bandwidth data, so the longer you run it, the
more accurately the percentage bars will portray your I/O bandwith usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Oct 25 23:43:23 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-NetFlame was too spiffy for me to not add it. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 13:42:53 PDT 1999
(KainX)

First off, I removed some unneeded variables from E-MemWatch.  I also fixed a
reporting bug in E-Disk.

But most importantly, I fixed Epplet_change_label() to avoid changing a label
to the exact same string.  This is the best place to handle this situation,
because it saves resources (we already have both strings to compare) and, due
to the nature of epplets, the probability is very high that this function
would only (or at least primarily) be called from a timer callback.  So it
simplifies client code this way too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 14:15:39 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Fixed E-Time to look better.  Should fix the problem with non-BlueSteel
themes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 16:06:43 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Okay, don't kill me.  I had to change the API again because it was broken.
Epplet_load_config() now takes no parameters.  I also renamed some functions,
which the following command should help you do:

perl -p -i.bak -e \
	's/config_data_with_def/config_def/g; s/_config_data/_config/g;' \
	<files>

That all goes on a single line, BTW.  And replace <files> with the names of
your .c files.  You must now specify any defaults by calling
Epplet_query_config_def() instead and passing the default to that function.

I also added the ability to right-justify label text by specifying a negative
x coordinate.  See E-Time for a sample.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Oct 26 17:44:38 PDT 1999
(KainX)

E-Sys, an uptime epplet that actually *works*. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Oct 28 18:58:52 PDT 1999
(KainX)

Basic cleanups on the config stuff.  I made sure that all epplets using the
config subsystem are using atexit(), and I added the same re-prioritizing
code that my epplets have to E-Cpu and E-NetFlame so they wouldn't be as
CPU-intensive.  E-NetFlame has also been upgraded to v0.3 with bandwidth
patches from Shawn (the author), and it also has a config file option for
which interface to monitor (default "eth0") for those who might want to keep
an eye on ppp0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Mandrake)

gave gilbertt access to put screenshoot in CVS.  YOU NEED TO MODIFY THE
CHANGELOG THOUGH.  fixed some warnings here and there.  I don't like warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 31 11:36:50 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-ScreenShoot. I guess I should include a recent Changelog:
Added dox help, including a couple of images to make things more clear.
Found several bugs in my drawing routines, and squashed them.
Added a couple of new cloak-animations.
Please let me know if you have problems building it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 31 21:36:50 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

New cloak-animation - text banner.
Fixed my bouncing ball.
Rand()omised my atoms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 1 22:06:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Nothing spectacular:
	Fixed some issues with a couple of cloak-anims
	Added SineWave. Unless I'm feeling wacky sometime, that just about
	does it for cloak-anims. Enough is enough ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 2 18:59:14 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Oh dear. There was something terribly wrong with my starfields. I think
there still is, but it's better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov  2 13:31:28 PST 1999
(KainX)

An update from Matt McClanahan <cardinal@dodds.net> to his previous patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov  2 18:28:36 PST 1999
(KainX)

A new cloak mode for E-ScreenShoot...random!  You can guess what it does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov  3 23:58:36 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

More late-night coding for Tom ;-)
The trouble with using a .1f format string for something which will
accept a < 0.1 value, is that the value is written as 0.
This is clearly not a good idea, and led to an interesting 5 minutes
bug-hunt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov  4 16:00:26 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Slides, a slideshow epplet.  This is just the initial version; more features
coming soon.  :-)

Also some API additions/bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov  4 18:39:32 PST 1999
(KainX)

Several new features for E-Slides and some new icons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov  5 10:44:18 PST 1999
(KainX)

The zoom button works now.  It executes an arbitrary command and replaces an
occurance of %s in the string with the current image filename.  The default
is "ee %s".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov  5 16:36:55 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Xss, an xscreensaver epplet.  Unfortunately, xscreensaver crashes my X
server on a regular basis, so I'll have to continue development for this at
home.  It currently has...issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov  6 12:03:16 PST 1999
(KainX)

Well, it seems to work pretty well at this point.  Now I just need to figure
out how to support multiple hacks (which is what those previous/next buttons
are for).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov  8 14:05:56 PST 1999
(KainX)

Multiple hacks are now supported in E-Xss.  Just edit your config file and
list as many hacks as you want.  The key values are "hack_0", "hack_1", etc.,
on up to however many hacks you want.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov  8 20:32:49 PST 1999
(KainX)

Raised the delay for qix (oops) and redid the date format in E-Time.  It now
shows the full weekday name and shows the day before the month.  I also added
a space for improved readability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov  9 23:31:01 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added some more goofy text to the banner cloak-animation, tidied up some
bits and bobs... I forget what else ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 19:13:17 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-Mixer. Probably b0rked the configure.in and Makefile.am, but it
compiles on my box (tm).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 19:48:22 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-SD. I don't think I screwed anything up in the process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 14:54:28 PST 1999
(Mandrake)

removed EppletTest and EppletConfigTest from install procedure.  no need for
those to be automagically installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 15:49:40 PST 1999
(KainX)

E-Mountbox is now size-matched with everything else, and the help/config/close
buttons appear and disappear just like the other epplets.  Consistency is a
good thing. :-)  Also, E-Xss won't show/hide the drawing area any more when
it gains/loses focus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 10 20:49:04 PST 1999
(KainX)

Oh my goodness.  This should resolve all the textbox silliness.  (At least all
that I've run across so far....)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 18:50:07 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

*Hopes KainX doesn't kill him*

Fixed a couple of things.
o No longer tries to open subdirectories as images (my
.enlightenment/backgrounds directory contains only two subdirs, tiled and
fullscreen, previously it dumped core trying to open these as images).
o If there are no images in the dir, the Epplet_dialog_ok was never shown,
as it was followed by an exit(-1). It must be followed (at some point) by
Epplet_loop() to work.

KainX: If I broke it, you can kill me :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 11:55:02 PST 1999
(KainX)

Okay, I've fixed the API issue with Epplet_modify_config(), and I've fixed the
weird Epplet_reset_textbox() behavior.  (For the record, there was never a
buffer overflow here.  The textbox contents are dynamically allocated and
resized.)

I also tweaked some of Tom's changes both for style and more robustness.  I
also fixed the OK dialog error the "right" way.  The real problem was not
calling Esync() before exiting. :-)

Now if only I could talk Tom into putting a newline at the end of his
ChangeLog entries.... ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 21:08:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changed ~/ to $HOME/ in the default E-ScreenShoot directory config, for
those people with strange obscure machines that just don't play ball :-P

Oh, and just for KainX, there follows TWO newlines. One for this entry, and
one to make up for the last omission. ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 20:04:39 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to epplets/E-Exec.c 

Added some buttons to E-Exec for later use in controlling the history feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 20:19:09 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to epplets/E-Exec.c 

Added some code to do a command history. A change to the api is needed for it
to work, so I'm committing this first so I don't screw anything up during the
api modification. currently the relevant code is commented out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 11 22:59:14 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to epplets/E-Exec.c api/epplet.c api/epplet.h

Ok. E-Exec now does command history of up to 15 items. Added
Epplet_change_textbox. Not thoroughly tested, but isn't that what users 
are for? *runs*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 00:50:41 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

changes to api/eppet.c

Textboxes can scroll now. It's a little weird cuz the right "limit" moves 
around. I need to fix the way it figures out where to stop spitting out
chars since upper/lowercase chars are not all the same width. I'll look into
it unless someone has some insight on this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 16:50:11 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to E-Clock.c E-Areas.c Emix.x E-Sys.c E-Mountbox.c E-Load.c
E-Memwatch.c

Using atexit(Epplet_cleanup) prevents all those "mulitple spawning on
startup problems" people get.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:02:56 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Changed some stuff in E-Exec (thanks Ian), to make it safer and fun for all ages. Also hopefully
fixed a potential bug in Epplet_change_config (same one Epplet_modify_config used to have).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:17:34 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Changed epplets/E-Exec.c

Added Epplet_unremember to cb_close.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:41:29 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added a feature to allow you to scroll off the end of the command history and 
back into a blank textbox. Was supposed to already be in, but for some reason 
it didn't work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 13:55:48 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Gee..wonder how many more commits I can get before 14:00...
Fixed a segfault bug in E-Exec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 19:14:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to E-SD.[ch]

I'm hoping to have fixed the occasional high cpu usage my epplet seems to
show for everyone except me...

Please let me know if it worked...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 19:14:21 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

More E-SD.c changes. Should be better, but let me know if any lag occurs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 12:35:49 PST 1999
(KainX)

Cleaning up the epplets is becoming a morning routine for me.... =P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 15:37:46 PST 1999
(KainX)

Some UI changes to make E-Exec a little more friendly. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 12 15:57:40 PST 1999
(KainX)

Wrap-around history.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 13 00:34:12 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Thanks to code from Steve Brunton <brunton@dweeb.turner.com>, E-Mixer should
now support IRIX. Please test this for me you funny hardware people you ;-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Nov 13 21:03:02 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Changes to : E-ScreenShoot.[ch] clock.[ch]

Renamed "Rotator" to "Mesh", and added new cloak-animation, "Funky Mesh"

I was bored. Ok?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 00:33:11 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added E-ScreenSave. Will control xscreensaver, but currently just locks the
screen on demand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 01:34:43 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Should have quashed all lag in E-SD. Please let me know

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 02:24:13 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added new animation to E-SD, called history, it is responsive to sound, and
will hopefully keep StriderZ off my back for a day or two :P

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Nov 14 02:53:54 GMT 1999
(gilbertt)

Added another animation to E-SD, "History Bar", its cooler.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Nov 15 12:30:13 PST 1999
(KainX)

Another morning, another cleanup.  Doesn't anyone use warning flags besides
me?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Nov 16 17:10:44 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Added a textbox cursor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 17 14:18:42 PST 1999
(KainX)

Cleanups to the libgtop stuff.  Someone (Mark) please tell me if this doesn't
work on Solaris....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Nov 17 21:46:41 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Made most of the functions in epplets/cloak.c non-static so that they can be 
accessed by other epplets. Also Added E-NetGraph, a wmnet wannabe epplet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Nov 18 11:57:17 EST 1999
(StriderZ)

Ok, added the *real* E-NetGraph to cvs. Coded by Daniel Erat 
(http://www2.ucsc.edu/~erat/). I had no idea this existed, it rocks. It takes 
hella command-line options, but I modified it to use a config file too. It may 
not run at first if your net device is not ppp0 and you don't specify. This 
will be changed.
