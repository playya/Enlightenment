Hi there, thanks for using this theme!  Here  are some notes
on how to install The Ganymede Theme on your machine:

1. If you are looking at this README  only because you don't
   have any buttons on your  desktop,  please run the script
   ACTIVATE_BUTTONS  which  is located in the same directory
   as this file.

   This will not only activate the  buttons but also install
   some default menus in your ~/.enlightenment. Feel free to
   adapt them to your needs like any other file menu, but do
   not change the name of the files.

2. The subdirectory "Ganymede"  contains a small Eterm theme
   that looks great (well, IMHO) with the  E theme.   Put it
   where you have your other Eterm themes and fire up Eterms
   using "Eterm -t Ganymede". NOTE: this theme is now inten-
   ded for Eterm 0.9.

3. The subdirectory "Ganymede_gkrellm"  contains a theme for
   the system monitor gkrellm, available at
   http://web.wt.net/~billw/gkrellm/gkrellm.html. 

You can get further help by clicking the  "About this theme"
item in your root menu.

If you are wondering about the name,  well,  it's one of the
satellites of Jupiter, actually the 7th and largest. I guess
that's all. Oh, and Ganymede was an incredibly handsome boy
from Troyan, kidnapped by the man of many liaisons himself,
Zeus. But that's another story.

Btw, there's also a Gtk theme up on gtk.themes.org.

Feel free to mail any comments, questions  &  suggestions to
the author at chrisk@engr.uconn.edu or kreibich@in.tum.de.

				    Have fun,
			   Christian Kreibich, December 99.
