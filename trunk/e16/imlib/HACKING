This imlib package has now been adapted to use automake and autoconf.
This means that you will need the usual GNU tools to build these in
maintainer mode from the CVS tree.  You can basically type

aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf
./configure
make

On top of that, it would be good to have ImageMagik, netpbm, giflib,
and the "assorted graphic libraries" (png, tiff, zlib etc...)
installed.  These support libraries can be found at

  ftp://ftp.labs.redhat.com/pub/imlib/
