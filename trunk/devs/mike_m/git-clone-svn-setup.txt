How to setup a git-svn clone after cloning from e.git

This guide is useful if you have SVN commit rights, but want
to use a git tree to develop your code.

The resulting git tree can be used to "git svn dcommit" code
to the SVN tree.

A git tree contains the entire history of E development.

Please remember that Enlightenment development is done in SVN,
so changes should be pushed to SVN when they build and more or
less work, daily if possible.

1) Clone enlightenment git (slow, but much faster than git svn clone):

   git clone git://git.enlightenment.org/git/e.git
   cd e

2) Add the following lines to the end of .git/config (replaing your username):

   [svn-remote "svn"]
           url = svn+ssh://mike_m@svn.enlightenment.org/var/svn/e/trunk
           fetch = :refs/remotes/git-svn

3) Add .git/svn/.metadata, with the following content:

   ; This file is used internally by git-svn
   ; You should not have to edit it
   [svn-remote "svn"]
           reposRoot = svn+ssh://mike_m@svn.enlightenment.org/var/svn/e
           uuid = 7cbeb6ba-43b4-40fd-8cce-4c39aea84d33

4) Update to one before the current revision:

   git rev-parse origin/master^ > .git/refs/remotes/git-svn 

5) Rebuild the git-svn index (should be quick):

   git svn fetch
   git svn rebase

To update, use "git svn rebase".
To commit, use "git svn dcommit".
