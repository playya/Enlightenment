h	- try quadtree support
	- fix Evas_Object_Polygon resize issue and API.
h	- use eina_lock
	- use eina_file_map

	- Add REVERSE to edje possible program action
	- Add continue: (ABORT|CONTINUE|CHAIN) to edje STATE_SET argument
	- Make it possible to catch requested file and to rewrite it
	- Reuse match automate between edje object of the same type
h	- Add specialized task for each match automate case
	- Add internationalization support
	- Add an optimizer to change edje layout for better performance
	- Add benchmark tools.
	- Try to improve speed of object destruction by moving them to another thread.
	- Add group { text, drag } setter.
	- Add group inheritance.
	- Add virtual part and program support.
	- Merge edje parser and edje preprocessor.
	- Move the parser into edje and expose an Edje AST API.
	- use ecore_animator_timeline_add.

* Elixir
h	- add eet -> js object
	- add elementary binding
	- add physique binding
h	- add eio binding
	- use eet connection
	- add explicit binding

* Explicit
	- add server
h	- add client library
	- integrate with edje (so we can request url image from lua, embryo or with USER directive)
	- integrate with elementary

* Efo
	- write module interface
	- write info manipulation library

* Et
	- write basic contact/place efo module
	- write elementary interface (pan + efo)

* Emap
	- write location efo module
	- write extraction code for devs info.txt
	- write elementary interface (pan + efo + maps)

* Eyelight
	- write own layout function
h	- fix expose and thumbnail display to be fully async
	- fix keyboard handling

* Eio 1.0
	- add notify support
h	- use dirfd helper (partial support with eina 1.0 and full with 1.1)
h	- add tutorial
	- add tests suite
	- use ecore_thread_reschedule_after and take device id into account
	during IO operation to limit a one disk per thread load.
	- handle all io in another process
	- pack result for same filename when calling eio_file_direct_stat (add a new set of call for that purpose).

* Efreet 1.0
d	- implement cache with icons directory content to avoid uneeded stat
	(should require a daemon to do the monitoring and the generation for
	every one in the background).
	- make mime check thread safe
	- make it a dbus daemon.

* Ecore 1.1
	- add ecore_thread_batch_run/ecore_thread_batch_feedback_run (to create
	batch, a list of data instead of creating one ecore_thread per data)
	- add ecore_thread_reschedule_after.
	- use eina_lock
	- add ecore_thread_ugly_run (better name: ecore_thread_message_run ?).

* eak - configuration library on top of eet
	- support text config and binary file
	- support variable number and location of backup file
	- look at elsa to understand the idea

* ethumb
d	- make exist function asynchronous
	- add generate cache

* enlil
	- use eio
	- improve use of multi cpu
	- make sync faster
