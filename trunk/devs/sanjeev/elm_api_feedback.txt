QuickLaunch
-----------
Not enough documentation about quicklaunch.
elm_quicklaunch_mode_set – use mode when multiple options are there. For Bool use quicklaunch_set/get

elm_need_* API"
---------------

EAPI Eina_Bool    elm_need_efreet(void);
EAPI Eina_Bool    elm_need_e_dbus(void);
Is it not a compile time option?"

elm_icon
--------
"elm_icon_memfile_set has optional format and edje key parameters.
Why should we provide format if it is optional? What is the point?

No documentation for elm_icon_thumb_set

elm_icon_no_scale_set rename to elm_icon_no_scale_unset, rather than _get.

Can these be named better?

Elm_Icon_Lookup_Order:
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_FDO_THEME, 
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_THEME_FDO, 
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_FDO, 
ELM_ICON_LOOKUP_THEME 

What is the difference between elm_icon_animated_set and elm_icon_animated_play_set?


actionslider
------------

No reference link to Elm_Actionslider_Pos in documentation.

Can we replace indicator with slider ?

anchorview/anchorblock
----------------------
Can they be replaced with one widget, if a scroller is the only difference."

elm_anchorblock_item_provider_append/prepend/remove – why do we need these API?
What are the use cases / examples?

background
----------

No reference link to Elm_Bg_Option for elm_bg.

ElmImage
--------

ELM_IMAGE_ROTATE_90_CCW, /rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise (i.e. 270 degrees clockwise)
*/  - Why not 90, 180, 270? (CCW, CW ?)

ELM_IMAGE_FLIP_TRANSPOSE, ELM_IMAGE_FLIP_TRANSVERSE - With the X and Y axes being at the top or bottom / left or right ?

elm_image_object_size_get - On error, neither w or h will be written. What will it be? Please set to something predictable (like -1).

Confusing
---------

elm_image_no_scale_get - this one for elm_image object itself.
elm_image_scale_get - this one is for the image file.

it might be helpful to add an 'object' to elm_image_no_scale_get.

ElmImage needs more description about size, aspect ratio, fill , prescale.

Box
---
elm_box_clear  =  elm_box_unpack_all + evas_object_del
elm_box_unpack_all = elm_box_children_get + elm_box_unpack

Note : 
To use elm_box_unpack() developer needs to maintain a reference or clue to the object.

Seems like multiple API wrapped on top of one another.



Looks like we are using matching function prototypes, that don't mean the same thing.

elm_box_layout_transition and Evas_Object_Box_Layout.

elm_box_layout_transition - This function can only be used with elm_box_layout_set()
elm_box_layout_set(box, elm_box_layout_transition, t, elm_box_transition_free);
elm_box_layout_set(Evas_Object *obj, Evas_Object_Box_Layout cb, const void *data, void (*free_data)(void *data))

Creating an object that holds the function pointers and passing it as a *data to another function that takes a function pointer... 

Does not look elegant. Should be a better way of doing this.
