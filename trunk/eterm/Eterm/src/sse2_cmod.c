 * Ported from <willem@stack.nl> Willem Monsuwe's original x86/MMX assembly 
 * code by Tres Melton in 2005 and 2006.  Anything copyrightable by me is
 * assigned to the Eterm project and its founder/maintainer: Michael Jennings.
 *
 *  Much inspiration was drawn from the original x86 MMX port written by
 *	Willem Monsuwe <willem@stack.nl> in pure x86/MMX Assembly.  The MMX
 *	instructions are taken almost verbatim but the memory and parameter
 *	accessing had to be completely reworked for the x86_64 ABI and to 
 *	ensure they worked with various gcc options.  Further the code was
 *	extended to take advantage of the 128 bit xmm registers in SSE2.
 *
 *  The imlib2 code in Enlightenment also has a lot to teach on the subject.

 *	AMD64 Application Binary Interface (v. 0.95)
 *		http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/documentation/abi-0.95.pdf
 *
 *  The 32 bit color modification algorithm is simple but so optimized 
 *    (even the C version) that it is almost unreadable.  
 *    Therefore the pseudo code is:
 *
 *	for each color of each pixel
 *		new_color = color * modifier
 *		if ( new_color > max_color_value )
 *			new_color = max_color_value
 *		end if
 *	end for
 *
 *  The AMD64 ABI is at version 0.95 and might change in the future.  Further it has changed a
 *	number of times in the past (although mostly in 2002-2003) as evidenced by the mailing
 *	list on http://www.x86-64.org.  The GCC, Glibc, and Linux kernel have changed as well
 *	during this time to keep up.  The standard C definition states that function parameters
 *	are to be passed on the stack but that can be very inefficient compared to passing them
 *	in registers so gcc tries to use registers.  This is very different than on the register
 *	starved i386 architecture (AMD64 adds 8 general purpose registers: %r8-%r15, and 
 *	MMX/SSE2/F87 adds 16 64/128/80bit registers: %xmm0-%xmm15. The x86_64 version of GCC uses
 *	registers as efficiently as possible and as a result exactly which registers are used
 *	for which parameters has evolved.  Since all of these tools change simultaneously inline 
 *	assembly code in C functions is the only way to ensure that this code will continue to 
 *	function through a (however unlikely) change.  If pure assembly were to be used as the
 *	original MMX author, Willem Monsuwe, did and the ABI changed then this code would cease
 *	to function properly.  
 *
 *  In Conclusion:
 *	Using C functions and inline assembly code should alleviate all of the concerns as the
 *	C compiler will ensure that the parameters get to the function in a gauranteed manner
 *	and the inline assembly explicitly loads them into the desired registers for the assembly
 *	code.  This might seem like alot of overhead but great care has been taken to adhere to
 *	the x86_64 ABI so that gcc/gas/ld will not perform any unneeded operations even when no
 *	optimizations have been enabled (-O[123]).
