Thu Sep  3 17:27:35 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Removed RELNOTES.Eterm and split it into README and ChangeLog.  I also
	fixed options.c so that keysym definitions are at least accepted.  Now
	I'll have to find a tn3270 to test with. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 17:57:38 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>	

	Added the trans theme and fixed doc/Makefile.in to remove Esetroot on
	"make distclean"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 18:36:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added the --shade option to replace the DARKEN_TRANSPARENCY #define.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 20:28:22 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed problems compiling with MENUBAR_MAX == 0 and without pixmap
	support and/or transparency support.

	Some unneeded code was removed from main.c as well.

	Added the --enable-menus (or --disable-menus) option to the configure
	script to automatically disable menubar support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 11:28:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added in the Eterm man page Shaleh <shaleh@debian.org> fixed up for us.
	Thanks Shaleh!

	Also updated the doc/FAQ.html file with the latest FAQ from the web.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 11:36:33 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Ripped the RELNOTES.Eterm stuff out of ChangeLog and put it in
	ReleaseNotes.  I decided not to use the name RELNOTES because it does
	annoying things with trying to Tab-complete "README". =)  From now on,
	ChangeLog will be the detail and RELNOTES will be the summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 13:24:49 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug mandrake pointed out where supplying a pixmap would kill
	a transparent Eterm.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 13:47:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the bug pointed out by technoir that made transparent Eterms
	flicker when there were two on the desktop at the same time and one was
	moving.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 15:42:55 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed scrollbar_floating with transparency so that the root image
	shows through underneath the scrollbar.  The effect is really sweet. :)
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 16:22:29 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed scrollbar_floating without transparency so that it shows the
	background color instead of white.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 18:48:08 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added the --tint option.  Specify a shade of tinting for a pseudo-
	transparent Eterm.  It implies --shade.  Choices are red, green, blue,
	purple, orange, or yellow.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 19:31:18 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a stupid mistake in doing the tinting.  Also enabled "yes" and
	"no" as valid boolean values.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 21:34:09 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the color names.  Thanks to technoir for assistance with this.
	Choices are now red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  5 14:28:18 1998	sdh

	Apply focus color change to menubar and scrollbars.  Remove old
	code that was surrounded by CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS.  Toss
	update flag that was exported by scrollbar.h and let menubar.c &
	scrollbar.c track focus independently.  Old code was doing a bunch
	of XCreateGC's without ever freeing the gc.  Still a bit kludgy,
	but no more so than the shadow color code for the menu/scroll bar.

	New config option, unfocusedscrollbar <color>.  Command line
	option --unfocused-scrollbar-color <color>.  Add config entry to
	themes/Eterm/MAIN.

	Turn on CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS by default in feature.h.

	Add color init entry for menuTextColor def_colorName (main.c).

	Why does menubar.c use the global Attributes exported by main.c?
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 13:50:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Updated the menubar files to take advantage of some of the newer
	background images in the collection.  Also removed the pixmap menu from
	the "trans" theme since it's all ignored anyway.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 15:14:00 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Cleaned up the changes made by "sdh" (whoever that is). :-)  If the
	unfocused color is not defined, it will revert to the scrollbar color,
	creating a way to "turn the option off," so to speak.  It also makes
	sure that people who don't want to see the difference don't see it.

	Added autogen.sh for the tragically habitual. ;-)
	
	By the way, a few pointers for those messing with Eterm.  For one,
	feature.h is created from feature.h.in, so changing feature.h does
	not affect the final distributed form of Eterm.  I had to update
	src/feature.h.in to define CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS in order to see
	the changes take effect.  For two, if you change the MAIN.in for Eterm,
	please change the other themes too.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 17:16:34 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed transparency so that it works on any desktop, not just the root.
	Only works with E, so non-E users are S.O.L.  (Sorry, that's life.)
	Thanks to raster for helping me with this. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 20:52:18 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added a new feature.  This was requested by Nick Vargish
	<nav@patriot.net>.  Basically, the new option --watch-bg (or config
	file toggle "watch_bg") tells Eterm to keep track of the mod time of
	the background pixmap.  If the pixmap changes, Eterm updates and
	redraws the background.  When coupled with an outside program, this
	can produce cycling and/or animated backgrounds.

	NOTE:  This feature is highly experimental.  It can crash Eterm if not
	done properly and carefully.  In fact, at this point it's more of a
	demonstration/proof-of-concept than a feature.  If there is enough
	interest, I will internalize more of it.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 13:18:31 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the scrollbar_floating option with transparency (again).  sdh's
	changes on 9/5 screwed it up.  The pixmap now shows through once again.
	And there was much rejoicing.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 16:08:06 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added .cvsignore files.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 10:11:41 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug pointed out by Hans Engren <h@ns.engren.org> which kept
	Eterm and Esetroot from working under certain conditions.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 11:38:06 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Final documentation cleanups before the release of 0.8.6.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 12:04:43 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Final compilation cleanups before release of 0.8.6.  With this commit,
	CVS will contain the release version of 0.8.6.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 14 12:58:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Installed 0.8.7 into CVS.  This release has some major changes in it.
	For one, Eterm now uses automake and libtool.  The old libmej is now
	built as a shared library as well as a static one.  Also, everything
	but the main() function has been moved into a library, libEterm.  Since
	most people use lots of Eterms at once, creating a shared library will
	reduce the text segment of each Eterm significantly, saving quite a bit
	of memory per Eterm.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 13:10:20 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug compiling on Linux.  (Damn Linux having dprintf!) ;-P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 13:23:00 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed another bug on Linux, this time with linking Esetroot.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 14:10:05 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Removed MIN_ANCHOR_SIZE and added -a (--min-anchor-size) option.  It
	is 0 by default so ppl won't complain about the scroll-up "bug".
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 15:03:57 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Changed the pixmap setting code in Esetroot so it will (hopefully) work
	better.  Geez, if everyone would just use Enlightenment, it would save
	me so much grief.... ;-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 16:00:26 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the scaling problem in Esetroot pointed out by technoir thanks
	to some code swiped from Enlightenment.  I also nuked the code that
	was killing Enlightenment when running Esetroot.  (Not an E bug, just
	lame code.) =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 17:25:53 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Choosing a pixmap in a transparent Eterm now works.  I also renamed
	StrSep() to strsep() and changed configure.in to check for strsep().
	That allowed me to remove some really annoying #ifdef's in command.c.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 17:59:24 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added initial support for an escape code sequence set to mess with the
	various transparency options.  It doesn't work yet, so don't bother
	trying to use it.  Some of it will even crash Eterm at this point, but
	I'm going home anyway.  :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 11:42:16 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Initial work on a patch for CygWin32 support.  Also updated autogen.sh
	to create libtool stuff.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 15:25:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed some misc. problems with the new escape sequences.  Toggling
	transparency on and off now works (more or less).  At least stuff won't
	crash. :-)  Still some kinks to iron out, as always.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 17:21:52 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the escape sequence for Pixmap -> None (again).  Also made the
	transparency toggle work for not having a pixmap.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 18:20:47 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Updated the default themes to include the Trans menu.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 13:05:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Hack for newer Linux versions in which the real uid must be nonzero to
	open the display.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 13:50:50 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Moved the #define for the Linux fix into config.h
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 16:59:17 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	This version has a working CygWin32 port! :-)  Some minor hacking may
	still be required.

	Also included a test for something with transparency.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:29:39 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Changed code to use setres*id() functions if they are there (Linux and
	HP-UX only AFAIK).  This is a vast security improvement for Linux.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:49:19 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Hopefully fixed privileges() for systems without setres*id() or saved
	uids.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 17:58:17 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	More .cvsignore entries.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 19:03:22 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Changed the --watch-bg option to --watch-pixmap, which will hopefully
	make it less tempting for people to think it has something to do with
	transparency.

	Also added the --watch-desktop option which causes Eterm to monitor
	the desktop pixmap for changes and update accordingly.  It doesn't
	cause flicker like it used to.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 19:36:56 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Some config file parser cleanups and additions to the trans theme.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:03:57 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Makefile and theme cleanups.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:45:03 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a major bug which caused Eterm to seg fault in trans theme.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:56:33 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed another seg fault bug, this time with changing the pixmap via
	escape sequence.  Doh!
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 21:03:34 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Changed the scrollbar_floating attribute back on for the trans theme.
	Geez, is there no end to the stuff I've screwed up today?? =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 09:33:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added some checks to autogen.sh
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 11:18:59 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Put in the #define IMLIB_TRANS, which will make Eterm use Imlib to do
	the transparency stuff.  There's a problem with it, though, either in
	Imlib_create_image_from_drawable() or the way I'm calling it.  For
	obvious reasons, it's off by default.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 16:39:15 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	As expected, raster's imlib fix corrected the problem.  Imlib
	transparency rendering now works as expected.  It is still off by
	default since tinting and shading aren't in yet.

	Also in this commit is a "fix" to autogen.sh.  I got complaints (well,
	actually one complaint) about autogen.sh not running configure, so now
	it does.  IMHO, this behavior is incorrect, as the function of autogen
	should be to GENerate the AUTOconf/AUTOmake stuff, not run it.  But
	since "all the other apps in cvs" run configure, for the sake of
	standardization and nothing more, I'll do it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 15:45:17 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the aforementioned memory leak as well as some others.  Dangling
	pointers were cut in half. :)

	Imlib transparency still needs to be worked on (read:  sped up).  One
	thing at a time though.

	I also fixed some duplicate rendering that was going on with
	pseudo-transparency.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 16:10:46 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the transparency toggle.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 17:05:31 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed bug in Imlib transparency code.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 19:46:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Looks like Imlib-based transparency is working now.  It only reads the
	desktop image once.  After that, it uses the same desktop pixmap
	throughout.  So startup is much slower, but through the rest of the
	run it's much faster.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 20:53:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added --shade-pct.  When Imlib-based transparency is enabled, you can
	specify a percentage by which to shade the background (0 being no
	shading, 100 being all black, not to mention rather pointless).
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 10:41:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	With Imlib-based transparency, Eterm now takes --tint as a numerical
	option.  You specify a 24-bit RGB mask for colored tinting, such as
	"--tint 0xffafaf" for a deep red tint or "--tint 0xefefff" for a slight
	blue tint.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 14:48:03 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug in non-Imlib-based transparency.  I also made preparations
	for letting non-Imlib-based transparency do shading percentages and
	tinting masks.  Works on 8bpp, but since that's the only thing I can
	test, I'll wait until tomorrow and make sure the other pixel depths
	work before I go further.

	Imlib-based transparency is pretty slow, but there's more that can be
	done with it as far as RGB curves and stuff, so I plan to keep support
	for it in there.  But I'd stick to using Xlib-based transparency for
	now.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 18:28:49 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the menubar code so that the menus aren't clipped by the window
	or screen edge.  There's still one small problem, but I'll look at that
	later. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 21:20:16 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	If root_pixmap() returns None, transparency gets turned off instead of
	rendering on a null pixmap.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 10:26:01 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed that one last menubar bug.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 11:46:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a segfault in Esetroot.  Also fixed --watch-desktop to work
	again (just for you, Nat). ;-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 19:07:11 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Some bug fixes pertaining to root_pixmap() failing, transparency and
	background pixmaps coinciding, etc.

	Also changed the shell_expand() function in options.c so that \'
	within single quotes would insert a single quote.  This differs from
	the shell behavior, but I prefer it. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 24 17:14:29 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug with tiling pixmaps in transparency code.  (Didn't do it
	the way raster wanted it, but it works for now.  I'll make it better
	later.  Unless raster wants to patch it....) :-)

	Fixed a bug building without CHANGE_SCROLLCOLOR_ON_FOCUS support.

	Changed config file magic numbers to "Eterm-0.8".

	The latter two are thanks to Casey Zacek <casey@netcomi.com>
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 22:32:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug in Esetroot.c and the CUTCHARS default in src/feature.h.in
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 22:35:44 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Missed another typo in Esetroot.c
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 26 21:11:48 EDT 1998    mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	cleaned up a lot of stuff so it compiles a little cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 14:04:39 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed utmp.c for OpenBSD thanks to Jason Ish <jason@obskure.net>
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 17:14:11 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Removed the variables mandrake commented out, except for the one that
	was still needed.  I uncommented that one and put it in #ifdef's to
	fix the compiler warnings.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 15:24:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Some transparency speed-ups (I hope).  Still trying to figure out why
	I'm not getting ReparentNotify events. =P  Also fixed the bug mandrake
	pointed out with transparency and the desktop dragbar under E.

	Also some fixes from Fritz Mueller <fritzm@digidesign.com> for X
	servers which lie about pixel depth and for a bug in Eterm's magic
	number checker.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 15:29:01 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Correct order:  Compile FIRST, commit SECOND.  Doh!! =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 12:06:10 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added --with-debugging[=num] to support debugging levels up through 5.

	Also added stack trace dump if the OS supports it.  In order of
	preference, the methods are:  U_STACK_TRACE() (on HP-UX in libcl),
	pstack (on Solaris), gdb, dbx.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 12:18:32 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Oops, forgot to add libmej/snprintf.c to the repository. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 11 17:35:18 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed autogen.sh so that VERSION was defined again.  Apparently
	running autoheader before other stuff in autogen.sh is a Bad Thing.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 17:38:30 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	If the desktop pixmap goes away (which happens if you're on another
	desktop for awhile), we'll just use the old one until it comes back.

	Also added Id strings to all C files.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 18:18:03 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added Id strings to the Makefile.am files, src/feature.h.in,
	configure.in, and autogen.sh.  Also added an entry to keep CVS quiet.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 12:55:13 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed the bug with dragging a transparent Eterm across E's desktop
	dragbar.  It reparents to the root window for a bit, but once you drop
	the window, it changes backdrops right on cue.  Also works when moving
	Eterm windows between desktops.  Note that this requires the use of
	the -W (--watch-desktop) option.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 13:02:37 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Nuked some leftover code from testing.  (oops)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 14:49:01 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added some debugging code to Esetroot.c and added the -x switch to turn
	on debugging.  Hopefully this will help me track down the DISPLAY bug.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 14 14:54:46 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Blah.  Forgot to "if (debug)" out a couple lines. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 19 15:33:48 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed transparency stuff so it wouldn't take up mondo CPU time.  Since
	we're getting events for other windows now, we need to make sure we
	only act on events that are ours.

	Also fixed scrollbar coloring in transparent mode.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 19 17:03:47 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New features courtesy a patch from James Antill <james@crazylands.org>
	as described here:

	\e[9n prints the pixmap filename in the title bar.  In transparency
	mode, prints transparency info to the title bar.

	--home-on-input option which split off part of --home-on-echo

	Replaced "strncasecmp(buff, "string ", num)" with macro.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 11:11:04 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug with -W and -x together.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 12:26:53 CDT 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Final documentation cleanups for 0.8.7 release tomorrow.  Barring bug
	fixes in the next 24 hours or so, this is 0.8.7 as it will be released
	sometime tomorrow morning.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 22 23:38:47 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* strings.c, strings.h: make everything consistent

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 22:26:47 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Major changes to the man page.  Hopefully people who actually bother
	to read the man page will find it easier to mess with the MAIN file.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 13:24:21 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Lots of changes here.  This is the first commit of 0.8.8.  The new
	features are:

	--shade now takes a percentage of shading.  0% is no shading, 100% is
	all black, and anything in between goes.  Percent sign optional.

	--tint now takes a 24-bit hexadecimal mask.  0xffffff is no tinting,
	0x000000 is black, and anything in between goes.  It will also take
	decimal or octal if you *really* have the urge, but hex is the most
	readable.

	-V (--menubar-move) now allows dragging the menubar to move the
	window.  It is on by default if the -x (--borderless) option is used,
	and off by default otherwise.

	The transparency/shading/tinting escape sequences now work.

	FORCE_BACKSPACE and FORCE_DELETE have been fixed.

	KS_DELETE (the strings associated with pressing the Delete key) is
	now set to ^? by default.

	-N (--anim) options for background pixmap cycling.  Syntax is
	"<delay> <background> <background> ..." where <delay> is the delay in
	seconds between updates and <background> is either "0 0 <file>" or
	"-1 -1 <file>" or "<file>".  This feature should still be considered
	beta.

	--with-cc argument to configure for forcing a build with an alternative
	compiler (for those who have pgcc but want to use gcc, etc.).
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 16:11:37 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Feh.  Got rid of the warning in command.c.  Chalk that one up to
	laziness on my part. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 19:56:15 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added an optional boolean parameter to ESC ] 6 ; 0 escape sequence.
	Also added code to clear the shading/tinting when loading a new
	pixmap.  This will be an option soon, but not tonight.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 19:17:58 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added support for the old color strings to the escape sequence handler
	for tinting.  They won't work on the command line, though.

	xerror_handler() will no longer exit Eterm.  We'll see how that goes.

	New --disable-stack-trace option to configure to disable stack
	tracing on abnormal termination.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  6 09:26:38 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Shading and tinting were broken for 2 days, and nobody told me.  Feh.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 15:38:11 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	No, I said *don't* exit on X errors.  And I meant it.  Really.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 20:00:08 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added src/Eterm.xpm as the default Eterm icon pixmap.

	Added the -I/--icon parameters to specify an alternate icon pixmap.
	The attribute "icon <filename>" is valid in the pixmaps context of the
	config file.
	
	Note that -I used to be --print-pipe.  Not any more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 11:47:42 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug when no background image was specified.  Dunno how on
	earth that happened....

	When Eterm gets the escape sequence to change the title, it will also
	change the icon name.  Not compliant with other terms, but I don't
	care.  What mandrake wants, mandrake gets. ;-)  Besides, sometimes you
	have to violate standards in favor of useability.  This is one of
	those times.

	When an icon is specified, use XGetIconSizes() to pick a size for it.
	When using the default, it's 64x64.  The WM can cope. :-)

	No, mandrake, it's still not ICCCM, but I'm working on it. :-)

	And no, raster, it doesn't snapshot the window.  I'll leave that one
	to you to write.  You can thank me later. >:)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 20:11:54 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Now the hosts in the chooser theme change the title bar instead of the
	menubar title, thanks to a new extended menubar function called
	"apptitle:".  See themes/chooser/chooser.menu for an example of it in
	action.

	Kterm (Kanji Eterm) now supports multi-byte fonts in the menubar,
	thanks to Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 12:18:00 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Wheee.  Minor bug fix.  Also redid the cvs_ident string declarations
	to make egcs happy. =P
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 16:33:17 KST 1998    Sung-Hyun Nam  <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	KANJI: Minor memory leak fix.  Change XLOCALE stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 03:10:50 EST 1998	Gerald Britton <gbritton@mit.edu>

	Esetroot.c: Fixed an X server memory leak.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Nov 12 08:54:58 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Reverted Gerald's change.  Been there, done that.  It kills E.  Sorry,
	but if the X server doesn't work right, that's not my problem.  I'm
	not going to kill E over it.  Tough break.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Nov 16 19:31:29 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Finally got around to doing that icon window thing to make mandrake
	and ICCCM (the next-to-worst acronym in history, second only to i18n)
	happy.  Are we there yet?
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 17 11:17:57 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixes for Digital UNIX from <wd@unx.dec.com>.  These were all "Stupid
	KainX" bugs that I didn't catch because GNU's cpp is more forgiving
	than most vendors' cpp's.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 13:39:34 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	This is the Correct (tm) fix to the memory leak pointed out by
	Gerald.  He and I had a pow-wow of sorts via e-mail with Nat and
	raster, and this is the solution that wasn't crapped on by anyone.
	:-)

	Just to document what we came up with....  Esetroot sets the
	_XROOTPMAP_ID property as always, but now it sets a companion property
	as well, ESETROOT_PMAP_ID.  Both are set to the same pixmap ID.  When
	Esetroot runs, it checks to see if _XROOTPMAP_ID == ESETROOT_PMAP_ID,
	and if so, it knows that it set the pixmap itself and can safely do
	an XKillClient() on it.  If they are not equal, calling XKillClient()
	would kill the application which did set it, most likely a window
	manager like Enlightenment or the patched versions of AfterStep or
	WindowMaker.

	No window manager code changes should be necessary.  If, however,
	a person were to write a "helper app" that sets the background (like
	Esetroot does), further memory leaks could be avoided by having that
	program set/change ESETROOT_PMAP_ID.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 16:26:22 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added -center (-c) option to Esetroot for centering the pixmap.  Most
	of these changes are from a patch submitted by Ralph Giles
	<ralphbla@sfu.ca>.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 20:05:05 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Some fairly useless stuff that I really don't even want to document
	for fear it might actually get used, and people will expect more out
	of it than they should.  If you really wanna know, diff it. :)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Nov 24 21:48:24 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New feature.  --pause will make Eterm wait for a keypress when the
	child process exits.  Useful most often in combination with -e.

	Also removed all traces of --watch-pixmap.  Good riddance.  -N
	(--anim) is much smoother and less bug-prone.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Nov 25 11:47:05 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Some bug fixes in the ongoing saga of KainX vs. The Solaris 7 64-Bit
	Kernel.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Dec  4 16:11:03 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Ok, this should make Eterm compliant with the GNU FHS.  I also did a
	LOT of futzing around with configure.in, so if I broke something in
	doing either of these things, please let me know.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Dec  4 19:45:39 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Feh.  Thanks Pavlov. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Dec  7 18:04:09 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	FreeBSD fixes, fixes for building without Imlib support (oops), and
	fixes for the RPATH problem with Debian and autofs.  Thanks to Murray
	Stokely <murray@cdrom.com> for continued help on the FreeBSD front.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec  8 12:10:55 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Another of the Eterm-specific escape sequences.  This one is \e]6;3\a
	which will force Eterm to update the pseudo-transparent background.
	To those who've complained about -W making things too slow...Merry
	Christmas. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec  8 16:55:44 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Another oopsie from the December 4th changes.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Dec 18 13:44:04 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	The long awaited selection options.  There are two new options here.
	The first, --xterm-select, duplicates xterm's treatment of cutchars
	(which is broken, IMHO, but some people want it).  The second,
	--select-line, causes Eterm to select the whole line on a triple-click.
	The default is now to select only to the end of the line plus the
	current word.  The corresponding config file attributes, xterm_select
	and select_line, both go in the toggles context.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Dec 28 18:20:01 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	From the Trying-to-Please-All-the-People-All-the-Time department...
	%random() seeds based on process ID *and* time(NULL) now.  Feh.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec 29 16:52:34 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	A new Eterm feature.  This one is called "Viewport Mode."  It is
	toggled on by the --viewport-mode parameter or the viewport_mode
	attribute in the toggles section.  The basic concept is that the
	background of the Eterm window becomes a viewport to a background
	image.  Kinda like pseudo-transparency, but not related to the desktop
	in any way.  As you move the Eterm window, the background moves too.
	Scaled pixmaps are scaled up to the size of the desktop, and a portion
	shows through as the background.

	Okay, so it's kinda hard to describe. :-)  Just try it and see.  I
	recommend getting several of them open at once using the same scaled
	image.  The effect is interesting. :-)

	Shading and tinting don't yet work with it, but I'm getting there.  At
	least it won't crash your X server, like it did mine earlier. :-)

	Credit to es9 on IRC for the idea.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec 29 17:12:57 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	And Tynian said, "Let there be Debian Stuff."  And there was Debian
	Stuff.  And it was good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Dec 29 17:51:21 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Viewport + shading/tinting escape sequences is fixed.  I also fixed a
	bug with shading/tinting.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Dec 30 12:07:18 CST 1998	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added an Eterm.spec.in file as submitted by techn0ir, with a couple
	minor changes.  I know nothing about this file, so I have no clue how
	well it will work, if at all.

	configure.in now generates Eterm.spec from Eterm.spec.in to do
	automatic version updating.

	Minor changes to the Description section in the Debian stuff.

	AUTHOR'S NOTE:  None of the RPM/DEB information contained herein was
	authored by me.  I have no idea whether or not it will work; I rely on
	the package maintainers for that.  Though the authors recognize the
	utility and necessity of binary distributions for the various flavors
	of UNIX, we cannot in good conscious support any binary packages
	ourselves, for the simple reason that we don't know them all, and thus
	cannot support them all.  Out of fairness, if we can't support them
	all, we shouldn't support any of them.  Furthermore, binary
	distributions (especially when packaged by people other than the OS
	distributors) tend to be quirky, and we cannot support all these
	quirks ourselves.  So let me make it clear once again that any RPM's
	and DEB's of Eterm that may exist are supported ONLY by their
	respective maintainers, NOT by the authors of Eterm.  Any problems
	which arise with these packaged distributions should be directed to
	the package maintainer.

	With that said, we would also like to extend our thanks to the
	various package maintainers, with special mention of Brian Almeida
	<bma@debian.org> and Sean Perry <shaleh@debian.org>, for their
	continued support and assistance with packaged Eterm distributions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan  4 13:32:32 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Hopefully fixed a bug with backquote commands that don't return any
	output.

	Hopefully fixed a bug with shell_expand() being called with a NULL.
	In the process, I added some ASSERT() macros which may or may not be
	portable.  If they are, I will replace all assert() calls with them.
	If not, I'll nuke the one I put in. :)

	There seems to be a bug in main_loop() at command.c:4668 that has been
	uncovered by one person's mutt.  I added some debugging stuff to help
	track it down.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan  4 14:31:06 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Stupid KainX error #13,471.8:  Don't use macros you don't have.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan  4 16:30:54 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Work-around for what is either a bug or unexpected behavior in
	Enlightenment.  Other WM's leave coordinate setting for negative
	geometries up to the app.  Enlightenment seems to do it itself.  So if
	Eterm is running under Enlightenment, it will not do the offsetting
	itself.

	I'm curious to know if this is a bug in E or in everybody else. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Jan  8 14:40:36 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Documentation updates for 0.8.8.  Wheeeeee. :)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan 11 14:30:02 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Use Imlib_best_color_match() for all colors we allocate so that we
	coexist peacefully with Imlib, E, Netscape, et al.  This should make
	raster's day a little brighter.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan 11 16:12:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed typos in MAIN.in files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Jan 11 16:34:41 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Long-awaited transparency improvement for tiled desktops.  Let's hope
	it doesn't break anything.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Jan 12 13:17:41 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Integrate random background functionality into Eterm distribution.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 10:49:02 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Add some more verbose output when color allocation fails.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 10:55:02 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Yes, Virginia, there is a 0.8.9.  Back to adding features.  Ugh. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 14:17:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	More for 0.8.9....
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 15:15:52 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Mouse wheel support.  Does it work?  I dunno, since I don't have a
	wheeled mouse and can't test it, but it should.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 21 17:59:47 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New --version option to display compile-time #define's.  Also
	switched --help output to stdout instead of stderr (people were
	complaining about not being able to grep it...apparently
	"Eterm --help 2>&1 | grep foo" was too much work).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 28 11:58:26 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed typos in MAIN files.

	Also, there's code in command.c to attempt to set the desktop on which
	to open in Enlightenment.  It's commented out because it doesn't work
	and I'm not sure why. =}
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Jan 28 12:29:20 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	An attempt at a fix, or at least to help find the bug.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Feb  2 15:10:43 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Tinting and shading speedups (about 30%) thanks to a patch from

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Feb  2 23:27:20 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	You want scrollbars?  We've got scrollbars. :)

	New --scrollbar-type option.  Takes a string parameter, one of
	"xterm", "next", or "motif".  I'm sure we can all guess what it does.
	:-)

	More work on this tomorrow, but I need sleep.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb  3 10:43:45 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed a bug with tiled desktop pixmaps and shading/tinting.  Thanks to

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb  3 12:26:20 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	The resize-to-crash bug has *finally* been squashed once and for all,
	thanks to a patch from Sebastien van Klinkenberg <klinkens@wanadoo.fr>.
	Thanks Sebastien!!
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb  3 14:55:26 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	scrollbar_type now works in the attributes context of the MAIN file.

	New option --scrollbar-width (and scrollbar_width in the attributes
	context in the MAIN file).  Takes a positive integer and specifies
	scrollbar width (in pixels).

	Always update the background on startup.  This will help in cases of
	override_redirect (-x), no window manager, or a buggy window manager
	(reported with Window Maker 0.50.2).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Feb  8 12:16:38 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fix for a tiny hiccup.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 11 19:39:00 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Ctrl-Click behavior has changed.  Ctrl+Button1 now does the old raise-
	and-steal-focus thing.  Ctrl+Button2 toggles the scrollbar.  Ctrl+
	Button3 toggles the menubar.  These behaviors can all be turned off in
	src/feature.h but are on by default.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 11 22:32:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added the --menubar boolean option to toggle whether or not the
	menubar is visible on startup.  There's also the "menubar" attribute
	in the toggles section, or you can put a boolean value after the
	filename for the "menu" attribute (e.g., "menu Eterm.menu off").  The
	visibility of the menubar can subsequently be toggled by the escape
	sequence or by Ctrl+Button3 on the term window.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 11 23:34:10 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added support for popup scrollbars (i.e., the scrollbar goes away
	when Eterm loses focus, and comes back when Eterm regains focus).
	This is the --scrollbar-popup option or the "scrollbar_popup"
	attribute in the toggles context.  Idea courtesy Rahsheen Porter
	<rahsheen@neuplanet.cx>.  Thanks!

	Also, thanks to OctobrX <x@themes.org> for the menubar ideas above.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Feb 15 19:38:54 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New -D (--desktop) option (and "desktop" attribute in the "attributes"
	context) to choose what desktop to load on.  NOTE:  This requires a
	GNOME-compliant window manager which supports the _WIN_WORKSPACE
	property as defined by http://www.gnome.org/devel/gnomewm/.

	No, I will NOT use the Eterm*desktop Xrdb resource.  Read the FAQ for
	info on why I refuse to use Xrdb in any way, shape, or form.  I would
	rather wait for other WM's to reach the 21st century.  (Enlightenment,
	of course, is already compliant.)

	Also changed some short options for stuff that is never used, namely
	the -D, -U, -B, and -A options for the pixmapped scrollbar that we
	don't even have. =)  -D became --desktop, and -B became
	--scrollbar-type.

	Muchas gracias to raster <raster@redhat.com> for his assistance with
	the desktop thing.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Feb 15 20:00:59 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Work around a nasty Solaris X bug in _XFlushInt(), called by
	XUnmapWindow().  If we're not unmapped after 3 seconds, call _exit().
	If _exit() isn't around, use abort().
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Feb 16 11:21:59 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Implemented scrollbar type and width changing via an escape sequence,
	namely "\e]6;10;<type>;<width>\a".  <type> is either "xterm", "next",
	"motif", or blank.  <width> is a positive integer of reasonable value
	or blank.  Leaving both values blank does nothing.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Feb 17 18:54:44 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Two whole days' worth of work here.  I added bunches of escape
	sequences.  You can now set, configure, or toggle just about every
	part of Eterm via escape sequences, and have the changes live-updated.
	Look at src/command.c starting at line 6136 for the individual
	sequences.  There's oodles.  You can change scrollbar type, width,
	and location.  You can change screens.  You can change selection
	behavior.  You can even move Eterm to a new desktop.  All via escape
	sequences.

	Along with this, I redid all the *.menu files.  They are now much
	more organized.  They also have support for all (if not *all*, nearly
	so) the escape-code-configurable aspects of Eterm.

	Look for a GUI theme generator/configuration applet (gtk+-based) in
	the near (?) future that will take advantage of this. =)

	Also, no more trying to load the CVS directory as a background pixmap.

Thu Feb 18 10:26:56 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Patch from John Ellson <ellson@lucent.com>.  Render style was not
	getting properly reset for line wrapping.  His patched fixed extra
	underscores...I also fixed the other stuff, including rev. video.

	Patch from Ryan Murray <rmurray@cyberhqz.com> to add an rpath to
	Esetroot when linking.

	Thanks guys!
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Feb 18 14:06:05 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Dammit.  I hate stupid bugs, and this is a big one.  Re-enable our
	own system() call, this time one that works.  If you setuid Eterm, you
	NEED this fix ASAP.  'Nuff said.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar  2 14:31:03 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Applied and corrected patch from Alexander Savelyev <fano@ham.kiev.ua>
	for supporting DESTDIR and for utmp on BSDI.

	Also fixed Esetroot for systems where root visual != highest visual.
	Thanks to Tomas Ogren <stric@ing.umu.se> for the patch.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar  2 17:27:22 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	The -C (--console) switch works again, at least on Solaris and Linux.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar  3 09:44:21 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Debian info updates from Brian M. Almeida <bma@debian.org>
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar  3 17:58:55 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Reformatted code using new script, aptly-named "reformat-code," which
	calls indent.  Now if only there were a few more indent options, like
	one to keep the brace and the end of the function definition, and one
	to force a blank line *before* the declaration section.

	Also lots of utmp.c cleanups, including one that should fix the dying
	on glibc 2.1.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar  3 18:04:49 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Oops, forgot some Debian files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 11 14:30:53 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Changed the default colors from names to rgb values (failsafe), and
	modified almost all of them to match colors Netscape uses.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 11 15:51:05 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Remove move-themes.in from distribution list.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sun Mar 14 12:32:36 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	By popular demand, the bright blue scrollbar/menubar scheme has been
	nixed in favor of a red/gray scheme that blends with the ShinyMetal
	Enlightenment theme.  I originally chose the blue to match the window
	border color in my StarTrek theme for E 0.10+.  I guess it was time
	for a change.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 16 09:21:53 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Checkpoint commit.  We're on our way to making debugging output a dual
	compile- and run-time option.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 16 17:34:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	. in config search path can cause nasty, hard-to-find weirdness.  So
	I nixed it.  I apologize in advance if you used it, but if you did,
	you probably have bigger problems.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar 17 16:59:25 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Completely redid all the debugging stuff to facilitate the creation
	of a run-time option for it.  The option isn't there yet; that comes
	next.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 18 14:24:48 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Finally fixed a long-standing font alignment problem in the menubar
	when using nexus, shine, and similar fonts with 0 descent.  I then
	nixed the lame hackish work-around I put in awhile back so I could
	ignore it for a bit longer. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Mar 18 18:05:30 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed another long-standing problem, this time with the placement and
	appearance of the menubar arrows, especially when --border-width is
	used.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 19 12:15:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New --debug option to vary the level of debugging output shown.  Valid
	values are integers 0 through DEBUG, where DEBUG is the value you set
	when calling ./configure with --with-debugging=N.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 19 17:34:52 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Implemented two new escape codes.  One is a simple "exit" feature than
	can be used from the menubar.  The other is a feature to save the
	current settings to a given file.  I added these two sequences to the
	menubar files.  The sequence for saving settings defaults to saving to
	the current theme, which is the behavior most users would expect.

	WARNING:  This saves *everything*, so if you have randomized
	backgrounds, tints, etc., DON'T use this!  They will go away!

	I haven't tested the save thing very thoroughly, so I'm not sure *all*
	the current settings save properly.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 19 18:20:28 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	After further consideration, added a routine to create a backup of the
	current MAIN file before overwriting it.  The backup is named with a
	timestamp, as in "MAIN.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS", so as not to conflict with
	any other backup files.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 22 10:23:58 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Changed configure.in so that the default level of debugging support
	compiled in is 4 (the maximum level that does not sync X events).  The
	run-time default is still 0, however.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 18:16:40 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Whoops.  Inverted one set of arrows too many. =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 18:50:36 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added support in the options macros for specifying a variable to which
	the bitmask should be applied.  (The variable Options had always been
	used before.)  This will enable the manipulation of multiple bitmask
	variables via command-line options with no additional code needed.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 19:43:38 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added long-awaited options to set the keypad and cursor key modes on
	startup.

	--app-keypad (or the "app_keypad" boolean attribute in the keyboard
	context) will start in "application keypad" mode.  NOTE:  The new
	default is to start in normal (numeric) keypad mode.

	--app-cursor (or the "app_cursor" boolean attribute in the keyboard
	context) will start in "application cursor key" mode.  The default
	continues to be normal cursor key mode.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 23 21:28:57 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Nuked several bugs relating to printpipe.  Also enabled it by default.

	Removed the forceable addition of the '-g' flag to CFLAGS if
	debugging is enabled.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 26 17:54:03 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Lots of code cleanups here, plus a bugfix for menubars.  I might have
	done other stuff too, I forget.... =)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 26 19:07:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added another little helper app.  This one is doc/Etbg, written by
	Brian McFee <keebler@themes.org> in a fit of boredom.  Thanks keeb!
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Mar 26 22:08:45 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	The rewrite of the Eterm Technical Reference.  It's HTML now, and is
	(at least to me) much more readable.  I've still got lots to add, but
	it's fleshed out enough to replace the old one now.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 29 11:25:24 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Oops.  Forgot to add the Kanji stuff to main.h.  Thanks to Sung-Hyun
	Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr> for catching this.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 29 19:37:38 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	This is an attempt to fix X locale support, which was broken on Linux
	(XFree86?).  Please (!) let me know if I broke stuff, especially you
	who use KANJI.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Mar 29 20:19:29 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Pre-emptive Kanji fix.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 30 13:07:05 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	More robust font set for XIC.  Should be able to handle any charset.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Mar 30 17:20:50 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Technical reference now includes complete documentation for all the
	Eterm-specific escape sequences.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar 31 18:47:18 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added support for the "ESC ] {l|I|L} string ESC \" sequences, a la
	dtterm.  'l' sets the title, 'I' sets the icon pixmap filename (or the
	default Eterm icon if "string" is missing), and 'L' sets the icon
	name.  Thanks to Mark Bowyer <Mark.Bowyer@uk.sun.com> for pointing
	these out.

	Look for more dtterm sequence support coming soon.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Mar 31 19:56:07 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	More work on the Technical Reference.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 10:25:35 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	At this point, the initial revision of the Eterm Technical Reference
	is complete.  I'm looking for comments, suggestions, errata, and so
	forth. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 10:37:57 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Some rearranging.  Now doc/ just contains documentation.  The utility
	programs have been put in utils/.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 12:06:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New, improved color grid script, Etcolors.sh.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 12:40:15 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	New, improved menu utility, Etmenu.sh.  Modified utils/Makefile.am to
	install these new utilities.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  1 17:48:47 CST 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Doh!  Man page booboo.  Thanks to Jim Niemira <urmane@urmane.org> for
	pointing this out to me.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 14:18:09 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Support several dtterm escape sequences for window operations.
	Documentation is forthcoming.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 14:41:11 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added a rule to build an HTML-ized man page in doc/.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 14:55:41 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Gah!  I'd love to know who the idiot was who decided to put height
	before width.... >:P
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr  5 15:15:42 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Documentation for new window ops sequences:

	ESC [ n [ ; n [ ... ] ] t
	
	n == 1: Un-iconify window 
	n == 2: Iconify window 
	n == 3: Move window. Must by followed by ;x;y 
	n == 4: Resize window. Must by followed by ;height;width 
	n == 5: Raise window 
	n == 6: Lower window 
	n == 7: Refresh window 
	n == 8: Resize text area. Must by followed by ;height;width, with
	        height and width given in characters. 
	n == 13: Report window position
	n == 14: Report window size in pixels
	n == 18: Report text area size in characters
	n == 20: Report icon name
	n == 21: Report window title
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr  6 13:33:18 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added support for UNIX 98 pty's under glibc 2.1, thanks to a patch
	from Mikolaj Habryn <dichro-7815e9e@eris.rcpt.to>.

	Also added a new option to configure.  Use --without-sense-of-humor
	to disable the little libKenny joke (for the humorously-challenged).
	Credit to Paula Bailey <pmbail01@slug.louisville.edu> for the idea.
	And this :-P is me sticking my tongue out at the people who made it
	necessary! :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr  7 10:14:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed several bugs related to the %include directive and magic number
	version checking in the config file parser, thanks to a patch from
	Boris Badenov <sluskyb@lizards-lair.stwing.org>.

	Also fixed a couple oversights in Makefile.am in doc/ and utils/,
	pointed out by Sung-Hyun Nam <namsh@lgic.co.kr>.

	Thanks guys!  :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 13:01:02 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Trying to get pty code in order.  There are some problems with glibc
	2.1 systems still.  I totally rearranged the pty-finding code, so I
	NEED lots of testing on this stuff.  Let me know if I broke/fixed
	anything.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 14:43:42 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Still trying to get that pty code in order.... :(
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 15:34:31 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	And again.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 16:21:21 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Now that the pty problems seem to be fixed (at least on Solaris and
	Linux), let's be a little more robust with failures.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr  8 18:11:46 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Fixed some assorted bugs and problems that occur when pixmaps.list is
	not present.  Also fixed a bug for output files that cannot be
	created.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr 15 16:01:03 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	The borderless Eterm options will now make Eterm set the MWM hints
	so that the window manager will render it borderless.  (If the WM
	does not support the MWM hints, however, Eterm will fall back on the
	traditional override_redirect behavior.)  I've only tested this on
	Enlightenment, but it should work for other window managers too.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Thu Apr 15 17:42:35 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added the type of each variable to the help output, as well as some
	additional info on how to use the command-line options.  You're
	welcome, llane. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Apr 16 18:03:26 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added a -fit option to Esetroot which scales the image to fit the
	screen while maintaining its true proportion.  Thanks to Remo
	Strotkamp <remo@ccrl.nj.nec.com> for the idea and some code.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 19 13:55:09 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Two bugfix patches.  One is for compiling on SGI IRIX, thanks to
	Kimball Thurston <kimball@sgrail.com>.  The other was a fix for the
	recently-discovered segfault problem.  Thanks yet again to
	Sebastien van Klinkenberg <klinkens@wanadoo.fr>. :-)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mon Apr 19 19:42:54 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Two more bugfixes.  Eterm now installs its X error handler earlier to
	catch more errors without dying.  Also, another patch from Sebastien
	van Klinkenberg <klinkens@wanadoo.fr> for the segfault bug.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr 20 15:20:00 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	I think this fixes all remaining menu flickering problems.  I also
	removed a goto while I was at it, because goto's are evil.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tue Apr 20 16:05:50 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added a new option.  --select-trailing-spaces (or the attribute
	select_trailing_spaces in the toggles context of the config file)
	causes Eterm to keep spaces at the end of a line as part of the
	selection.  The new default behavior is to remove these trailing
	spaces.  If you select text in mutt (or other SLang programs), you
	will thank me.

	Also did some options-related cleanups in preparation for release.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 21 09:58:36 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	This should take care of the man page for the release of 0.8.9.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wed Apr 21 10:20:33 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Added support, documentation, and .menu file entries for an escape
	code to toggle the select-trailing-spaces feature.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fri Apr 23 15:55:18 CDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@mw.3com.com>

	Support the omission of the operator in an xterm escape sequence.
	Adding support for the dtterm stuff broke this.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
