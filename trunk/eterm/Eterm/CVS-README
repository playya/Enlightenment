As of 31 August 1998, Eterm is now available via anonymous CVS from
anoncvs.gnome.org.  If you don't know how to use CVS, don't use it.
The authors, of course, don't guarantee anything whatsoever about
Eterm being functional; we guarantee even less if you get it from
CVS.  We will try to remember to test things before we commit them,
but we make no promises. :-)

Happy terming!
