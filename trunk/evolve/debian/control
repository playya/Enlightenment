Description: library that allows you to specify an Etk application's interface using an Edje (C style) like language
 Evolve is a library that allows you to specify an Etk application's interface
 using an Edje (C style) like language. The sources (.etk files) can be compiled
 (into .eet files) and can then be hooked up to your applications logic.
 .
 Evolve also contains a gui, Evolve Builder that allows you to build Evolve
 files using a graphical user interface (work in progress).
