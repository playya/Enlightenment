 * The Eio library is a library that implements an API for asynchronous
 * input/output operation. Most operation are done in a separated thread
 * to prevent lock. See @ref Eio_Group. Some helper to work on data
 * received in Eio callback are also provided see @ref Eio_Helper.
 *
 * This library is cross-platform and can be compiled and used on
 * Linux, BSD, Opensolaris and Windows (XP and CE).
