Rage 0.2.0

This is a media center designed mostly for use on a television hooked up to
your pc via a remote control. see the key controls at the end to make your
remote send the right keystrokes - eventually this will be 100% configurable
via the gui.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS - it is NOT COMPLETE. do not expect everything to
work and do what you want.

Configuration:

mkdir ~/.rage

edit ~/.rage/volumes

1 line in this file is a path to a media volume to use for media. eg:

/home/user/files/my_media
/media/cdrom
/media/nfs/server

etc.

just add lines per media volume to scan and add to your media library.
