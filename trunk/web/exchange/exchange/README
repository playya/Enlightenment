Exchange is the web application that runs exchange.enlightenment.org

For Administrators:
-------------------
Administrators are expected to test and approve themes, apps & modules.
Administrators are also responsible for moderating comments and building a positive atmosphere for the community.
Administrators should test themes to make sure they are bugfree and do not cause problems when in use. However, administrators should not disapprove themes simply because they look bad.

For Developers:
---------------
Exchange is built on top of the symfony (1.1) framework for PHP.
I recommend going through some of the documentation here http://www.symfony-project.org/doc/1_1/
At least the first two chapters of the book.
Exchange also uses PHPDoctrine instead of symfony's default ORM.
http://www.phpdoctrine.org/

If you are working on developing Exchange, it is recommended that you have a copy of the web application running on your local machine.
For this you will need a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, Mysql & PHP)
You must download symfony 1.1 and setup a database for exchange.
Edit config/databases.yml and configure your webserver to point to web/index.php

To push changes to the actual website, login to the server
cd /var/www/exchange
sudo ./sync.sh

If there are any css/js changes, copy them:
cp exchange/web/css/* html/css/
cp exchange/web/js/* html/js/

Remember: Always backup the database and the /var/www/exchange/html/ folder before performing any updates.

If you are making changes to the database schema, you need to edit config/doctrine/schema.yml and create a migration.
symfony doctrine:generate-migration

On the production server, run:
symfony doctrine:migrate exchange
to migrate the production database.
