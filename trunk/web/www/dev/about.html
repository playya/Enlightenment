                    <p>How did E start? As is often the case with open source
                    projects, scratching a developer's itch. In this
                    particular case it was Carsten (rasterman) Haitzler's. The
                    year was 1996 and he felt dissatisfied with the current
                    state of window managers, there was no reason for powerful
                    workstation and a cheap Amiga to be indistinguishable from
                    each other. Does function necessarily impairs form?
                    Perhaps an environment that also felt "right" would make
                    you more productive. He began hacking FVWM to experiment
                    with this idea but architectural issues got in the way. By
                    the end of the year it became clear that writing a window
                    manager from scratch would be the safest path.</p>

                        go to the extreme more than with Enlightenment. By the
                        time we've reached 1.0, you'll never be able to look
                        at another window manager or GUI the same way.</a></p>

                    <p>An ambitious goal statement for the website of a free
                    software project at the beginnings of 1998. While the team
                    had been working on its window manager only for about a
                    year, the project's goals and design philosophy were
                    already taking the shape we see today. The premise seemed
                    simple enough: <q>"the user should maintain control of his
                    desktop at all times"</q>. But making such capabilities
                    available to the end-user was not immediately obvious 4
                    years before the now famous Firefox browser was released
                    and extensions became commonplace for the average desktop
                    user.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Why should you have to change window managers every
                        few weeks when you need some new feature? You should
                        be able to embed the feature into it or be able to
                        find someone else who can or has already done so.
                        [...] Everything from simple backgrounds to the
                        multiple border decoration styles surrounding the
                        various windows on your desktop can be defined and
                        modified until you are satisfied with its graphical
                        layout and behavior.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The seemingly overwhelming nature of such environment
                    didn't discourage the developers who envisioned a
                    <q>"highly customizable definition language"</q> to deal
                    with it. By the time the project's first complete rewrite
                    (Enlightenment DR0.14) was released, said language was
                    customizable to the point it could be used successfully
                    for both configuration and themeing. The syntax itself was
                    customizable and made possible for themers to use their
                    native languages as keywords. Background could become
                    Hintergrund, Fond or Fondo depending on the designer's
                    nationality. Beyond keywords the syntax was quite simple
                    and complemented only by blocks delimited with {curly}
                    {brackets}.</p>

                    <p>At run-time, the window manager would load the selected
                    configuration or theme file and parse it line by line into
                    the necessary data structures. The aesthetic features of
                    the theme were built from a combination of standard image
                    files and rendering parameters specific to each file
                    defined in the theme's configuration. Making possible
                    advanced features such as identifying the areas of the
                    image that should to be stretched as a border or corner
                    without additional programming. To abstract the
                    manipulation of these image files and X-Windows
                    draw-ables, the first version of Imlib was created. An
                    advanced graphic library capable of using either Xlib or
                    GDK at the back-end.</p>

                    <h4>Steady progress to DR0.16</h4>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p><a href= 
                        "http://web.archive.org/web/19990428135920/www.enlightenment.org/news.html">
                        For those of you who partake of the virtues of the
                        GNOME CVS repository, or of the latest Enlightenment
                        snapshots, the filesize has jumped to an incredible
                        whopping 5MB! The reason? A bundled assortment of
                        TrueType fonts that you can use from within
                        Enlightenment for spicing up those windows.</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>By August 1998 CVS snapshots of DR0.15 were released
                    regularly as tarballs weighting five outrageous megabytes.
                    While the blame could be placed on the image files and
                    TrueType fonts, in time, the source code did inevitably
                    grow as a result of new features like eesh, a separate
                    console application that exposed the window manager's IPC
                    commands to the end user. Work on a front-end for the
                    configuration files had also started since: <q><a href= 
                    "http://web.archive.org/web/19990826131641/www.linuxpower.org/display_item.phtml?id=69">
                    "You shouldn't HAVE to ever touch the config file if you
                    don't want to"</a></q>.</p>

                    <p>The format of the theme configuration files had changed
                    to a collection of C-like macros. These files were later
                    parsed through a wrapper of the GCC preprocessor called
                    epp, which was also a separate application distributed
                    along the WM. The parsed result was compressed along with
                    the images and fonts into a gzip file to be passed around
                    using ".etheme" as the extension. This process sped up
                    theme loading considerably and hinted at the system that
                    would deal with theme files in the future.</p>

                    <p>Even while DR0.15 was groomed for its March 1999
                    release, work on DR0.16 was already underway. The initial
                    versions of DR0.16 maintained the code-base and file
                    formats used by its predecessor. The focus had shifted to
                    new features and easier better interfaces, after all,
                    DR0.14 was expected to be the project's last rewrite. By
                    September 1999 development of new features for DR0.16 was
                    halted, the new version would be released a month later
                    presenting a large number of new features with only a
                    modest increment of the code-base.</p>

                        possible threading of rendering routines for SMP
                        machines (ie spawn 4 rendering threads for a 4CPU
                        machine to max out its processing power). This is a
                        big project - ambitious but doable - it will take a
                        long time to see it come to completion though.</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Raster's ambitions for DR0.17 eventually outgrew the
                    features provided by the first version of Imlib. Now
                    common graphical capabilities like alpha blending or
                    anti-aliasing for shapes as well as text were quite new at
                    the time. Keeping up with the renewal of image formats
                    also required a new design that abstracted image loaders
                    from the rest of the library. Working these features
                    (among others) into the current version of Imlib would
                    provide more complications than benefits in contrast to
                    simply creating a new library. Imlib2 was born as a
                    separate library to cover these features and could be used
                    in conjunction with original Imlib.</p>

                    <p>The year 2000 saw new libraries come to life to support
                    new features and to modularize existing code in the window
                    manager. As the intended feature list for DR0.17 became
                    more ambitious the number and size of libraries escalated.
                    The new ecosystem would inspire a second rewrite 3 years
                    later.</p>

                        Imlib is still in heavy usage, Imlib2 has become a
                        critical part of many projects. EVAS is going to be a
                        significant force in the future, and will be as big a
                        hit as Imlib. Not only that, our library collection
                        includes a full widget library (EWL) based on EVAS,
                        several convenience libs (Ecore, Eprog, EWD),
                        libraries for text rendering in EVAS (Etox, Estyle), a
                        packaging and distribution format (EET), a database
                        (EDB), and a revolutionary themeing scheme (Ebits,
                        Ebg). Not to mention tools for EDB (e_gtk_ed,
                        Ebindings, etc), and Ebits/Ebg (Ebony, Etcher). We've
                        got the file manager backend completed (EFSD). We've
                        got a widget daemon (Ewidgetd), one of the nicest
                        image viewers ever written (Entice), and two file
                        managers (Essence, Evidence). And there is more than
                        that! We're running out of words that start with
                        E.</a></p>

                    <p>In the following 8 years many libraries were created,
                    rewritten and deprecated, each built around the original
                    ideal of making customization and extension for both
                    aesthetics and functionality accessible. To support such
                    ideal a good number of convenience wrappers for the
                    underlying system and emerging desktop standards were
                    created. In the end, the majority of the libraries born
                    during the three year period between 2000 and 2003 would
                    be either deprecated or rewritten to the point they became
                    unrecognizable. The most notable of them being Evas, <q>"a
                    hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows"</q>.
                    Initially created for themeing the Enlightenment File
                    Manager, Evas would eventually shape the architecture and
                    aesthetics of the whole project to its current state.</p>

                        <p>Evas is a solution to a problem, that at the time
                        had no other solution. The problem was that we needed
                        a rendering abstraction layer for X11 that allows for
                        alpha blending, anti-aliasing and image manipulation
                        on a structured, rather than immediate-mode level. One
                        that would also optimise the display of such
                        structured objects and also allow for hardware on
                        existing and future machines to accelerate this
                        rendering without requiring the CPU to do all the
                        work. <a href=

                    <p>While in 2001 the graphical capabilities of both
                    versions of the window manager, DR0.16 and DR0.17, were
                    still way ahead of its counterparts in the open source
                    world they were not issue-free. The performance in bottom
                    line hardware was less-than-stellar when it came to
                    rendering the most complex themes, which often featured
                    large bitmaps and extravagantly shaped window borders. New
                    methods to create better-performing yet complex themes
                    were needed and Imlib2 simply did not cut it. A canvas
                    library was planned that would complement Imlib2 and
                    provide the required advanced functionality at a faster
                    speed. Evas became the way every graphic element would be
                    displayed in DR0.17 and was not only more advanced but
                    required even less code to work its magic.</p>

                        Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything
                        that resembles what you call the desktop. Windows has
                        won. Face it. The market is not driven by a
                        technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its
                        crashes a few times a day. Users don't (mostly) care.
                        They just reboot and get on with it. They want apps.
                        If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a
                        lose-lose. Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its
                        life on the desktop is limited to nice areas (video
                        production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX
                        core now will probably end up ruling the roost). The
                        only place you are likely to see Linux is the embedded
                        space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things well.
                        There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a
                        lot of the apps are custom written. It's still a
                        mostly level playing field. This is where the
                        strengths of Linux can help make it shine.</a></p>

                    <p>By 2002 Raster had been porting his favorite libraries
                    to various embedded devices while he worked for a small
                    Sydney contracting firm. While this process boosted the
                    libraries' performance, the window manager itself was
                    pushed further away from the spotlight. The original
                    branch of the project became pretty much leaderless, the
                    number of libraries and legacy code continued to creep.
                    Eventually the development of DR0.17 was grind down to a
                    halt by the at least 12 different libraries and utilities
                    that competed to serve it, often duplicating features
                    found in each other. At this point the inevitable process
                    of merging and deprecating libraries and utilities began.
                    It was decided that the development of DR0.17 would be
                    halted until these issues were sorted out. Eventually the
                    window manager itself wold be completely rewritten.</p>

                    <h4>A new beginning for DR0.17</h4>

                    <p>Evas became independent of Imlib2 and gained support
                    for multiple rendering engines including Xlib,
                    Frame-buffer and OpenGL. Since Evas was the base of
                    DR0.17, the window manager became independent of Imlib2 as
                    well. The previous themeing system known as Ebits which
                    used Edb to store its data was replaced with the more
                    capable Edje, a proper declarative language reminiscent of
                    the DR0.14 days that used a simpler data serialization
                    library known as Eet. Configuration storage was moved to
                    Eet as well removing Edb from the dependency list.At this
                    point many utilities that were built around Edb met their
                    demise at this point as well.</p>

                    <p>In parallel to this process DR0.16 underwent a massive
                    move from Imlib to Imlib2. Since 2004 development of this
                    branch had continued steadily under the direction of Kim
                    Woelders and was not only kept up to date but gained new
                    features. Moving to Imlib2 deprecated the original library
                    to the point that the name "Imlib" became synonymous with
                    Imlib2 instead.</p>

                    <p>Other convenience libraries and utilities as Edb, Efsd
                    and Ebony proved to be not convenient enough to warrant
                    their maintenance and slowly deprecated. Some libraries
                    that strayed too far from their window manager scope such
                    as Etox shared the same fate. The majority of the
                    remaining libraries were revised and merged into Ecore.
                    This process continued well into 2007 until DR0.17
                    consolidated around Eet, Evas, Ecore, Embryo and Edje. In
                    the following years, functionality duplicated by Evas and
                    Ecore consolidated in Eina while the rise of two modern
                    freedesktop.org standards, DBus and Desktop Menus, was
                    addressed with two new libraries called E_Dbus and Efreet
                    respectively.</p>

                    <p>Today we find the code and architecture of DR0.17 to be
                    radically different to those of DR0.14 yet the philosophy
                    was consistently maintained. Many past statements are
                    truer today than when they were made. While its advanced
                    features put DR0.17 far above above the rest of the window
                    managers, it remains light enough to be successfully used
                    in embedded devices. Made possible through extreme
                    modularity, this middle point between window manager and
                    the desktop environment is the reason DR0.17 is referred
                    to as a "desktop shell".</p>
