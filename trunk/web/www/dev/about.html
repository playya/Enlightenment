                more than with Enlightenment. By the time we've reached 1.0,
                you'll never be able to look at another window manager or GUI

        <p>
            An ambitious goal statement for the website of a free software
            project at the beginnings of 1998. While the team had been working
            on its window manager for about a year, the project's goals and
            design philosophy were already taking the shape we see today. The
            premise seemed simple enough: <q>"the user should maintain control
            of his desktop at all times"</q>. But making such capabilities
            available to the end-user was not immediately obvious 4 years
            before the now famous Firefox browser was released as such.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Why should you have to change window managers every few weeks
                when you need some new feature? You should be able to embed
                the feature into it or be able to find someone else who can or
                has already done so. [...] Everything from simple backgrounds
                to the multiple border decoration styles surrounding the
                various windows on your desktop can be defined and modified
                until you are satisfied with its graphical layout and
                behaviour.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The seemingly overwhelming nature of such environment didn't
            discourage the developers who envisioned a <q>"highly customizable
            definition language"</q> to deal with it. By the time the
            project's first complete rewrite, Enlightenment DR0.14, was
            released this language was customizable to the point it could be
            used successfully for configuration and themeing. The language
            itself was customizable and made possible for themers to write
            keywords in their native languages. Background could become
            Hintergrund, Fond or Fondo depending on the designer's preference.
            Syntactically simple, the declarative language consisted blocks of
            keywords and values delimited by curly brackets, "{}", with the
            value being another block for some of the keywords.
        </p>
        <p>
            At run-time, the window manager would load the selected
            configuration or theme file and parse it line by line into the
            necessary data structures. The aesthetic features of the theme
            were built from a combination of standard image files and
            rendering parameters specific to each file defined in the theme's
            configuration. Making possible advanced features such as,
            identifying the areas of the image that should to be stretched as
            each border or corner, without additional programming. To abstract
            the manipulation of these image files and X-Windows drawables, the
            first version of Imlib was created. Its worth noting that Imlib
            allowed using either Xlib or GDK as back-ends.
        </p>

                For those of you who partake of the virtues of the GNOME CVS
                repository, or of the latest Enlightenment snapshots, the
                filesize has jumped to an incredible whopping 5MB! The reason?
                A bundled assortment of TrueType fonts that you can use from
                within Enlightenment for spicing up those windows.</a>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            By August 1998, CVS snapshots of DR0.15 were released regularly as
            outrageous 5MB tarballs (mostly due to image files and TrueType
            fonts). In time, the source code would grow at the same pace the
            window manager gained new features such as eesh, a separate
            console application that exposed the window manager's IPC commands
            to the end user. Work on a front-end for the configuration files
            had also started since: <q><a href=
            "http://web.archive.org/web/19990826131641/www.linuxpower.org/display_item.phtml?id=69">
            "You shouldn't HAVE to ever touch the config file if you don't
            want to"</a></q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The format of the theme configuration files was changed to a
            collection of C-like macros. These files were later parsed through
            a wrapper of the GCC preprocessor called epp, also a separate
            application. The parsed result was compressed along with the
            images and fonts into a gzip file to be passed around using
            ".etheme" as the extension. This sped up and simplified the
            process to load and setup the themes and hinted at how the window
            manager would deal with theme files in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even while DR0.15 was groomed for its March 1999 release, work on
            DR0.16 was already underway. The initial versions of DR0.16
            maintained the code-base and file formats used by its predecessor
            and focused on providing new features and easier setup interfaces,
            after all, DR0.14 was expected to be the project's last rewrite.
            By September 1999 DR0.16 development of new features was halted
            and when the project was released in October a modest increase in
            the code-base provided a large number of new features.

        <p>
            Raster's ambitions for DR0.17 eventually outgrew the features
            provided by the first version of Imlib. Now common graphical
            capabilities like alpha blending or anti-aliasing for shapes as
            well as text were quite new at the time. Keeping up with the
            renewal of image formats also required a new design that
            abstracted image loaders from the rest of the library. Working
            these features, among other things, into the current version of
            Imlib would provide more complications than benefits when opposed
            to the creation of a new library. Imlib2 was born as a separate
            library that could be used in conjuntion with Imlib.
        </p>
        <p>
            The year 2000 saw other libraries come to life to support new
            features or modularize existing code. As the feature list for
            DR0.17 became more ambitious, the escalation of new features and
            libraries would lead the way for the second rewrite for the
            project roughly 3 years later. The process was not planned, there
            was no public announcement outlining the intention of a rewrite
            until it began. The project simply shifted its focus from a Window
            Manager Project to a Development Libraries Project that used the
            window manager as a testing ground and inspiration for new library
            features.

            In the following 8 years many libraries were created, rewritten
            and deprecated. Each built around the original ideals of
            accessible customization and extension of aesthetics and
            functionality. Libraries were also created as convenient wrappers
            and abstractions of system resources or emerging desktop
            standards. Most of the libraries created were eventually
            deprecated or rewritten to the point that those surviving today
            wouldn't be recognized by their 2000-2003 cousins. The most
            notable library to emerge during this period was Evas, <q>"a
            hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows"</q>. Initially
            created for the Enlightenment File Manager, Evas would shape the
            architecture and aesthetics of the project to what it is today.

                Evas is a solution to a problem, that at the time had no other
                solution. The problem was that we needed a rendering
                abstraction layer for X11 that allows for alpha blending,
                anti-aliasing and image manipulation on a structured, rather
                than immediate-mode level. One that would also optimise the
                display of such structured objects and also allow for hardware
                on existing and future machines to accelerate this rendering
                without requiring the CPU to do all the work. <a href=

            The year was 2001 and the graphical capabilities of any version of
            the window manager were still way ahead of its counterparts in the
            open source world. But the performance in bottom-line hardware of
            the time was less-than-stellar when it came to rendering the most
            complex themes, often featuring large bitmaps and extravagantly
            shaped window borders. New methods to create better-performing yet
            complex themes were needed and Imlib2 would not be enough. A
            canvas library was built to complement Imlib2 and provide such
            advanced functionality at a faster speed while reducing the amount
            of code necessary. Evas became the way every graphic element would
            be displayed in DR0.17.

            By 2002 Raster was publicly stating that the focus on embedded
            devices was critical for the project and that he was working on
            porting the libraries to some of them while he worked for a Sydney
            contracting firm. DR0.17 found itself pretty much leader-less and
            moved further away from the spotlight. Around September 2003 the
            amount of libraries and legacy code in the Window Manager had
            slowed down development. At this point there were about 12
            libraries and utilities related to DR0.17, some of them
            replicating functionality or incompatible with each other. Thus
            began a slow process of merging and deprecating libraries and
            utilities alike. It was decided to stop development of DR0.17
            until these issues were sorted out and eventually the window
            manager itself wold be completely rewritten.
        </p>
        <p>
            Evas became independent of Imlib2 and gained support for multiple
            rendering engines including Xlib, Frame-buffer and OpenGL. DR0.17
            became independent of Imlib2 as well. The previous themeing system
            known as Ebits which used Edb to store its data was replaced with
            the much more capable Edje, which was syntactically similar to the
            original language used in DR0.14, and used used the simpler Eet
            data serialization library. Since DR0.17 also used Eet to store
            the configuration Edb was no longer a dependency. Some DR0.17
            utilities built around Edb met their demise at this point as well.
            Around this time DR0.16, which had progressively improved all
            these years moved from Imlib to Imlib2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other convenience libraries like Ewd, Eprog and Efsd proven not to
            be convenient enough to warrant their maintenance and slowly
            became deprecated. Other libraries that provided advanced
            functionality that the Window Manager did not use directly like
            Etox suffered the same fate. This process continued well into 2007
            when DR0.17 consolidated around Eet, Evas, Ecore, Embryo and Edje.
            Later, duplicated functionality in Evas and Ecore would
            consolidate in Eina and two additional libraries were created to
            support Dbus (E_Dbus) and other Freedesktop.org standards
            (Efreet).
        </p>
        <p>
            Today we find the code and architecture of DR0.17 to be radically
            different to those of DR0.14 yet the philosophy was faint fully
            maintained. Many past statements are more true now than when they
            were made. DR0.17 sports features so advanced that puts it above
            the rest of the window managers yet remains so much lighter than a
            desktop environment that can be successfully used in embedded
            devices. To address this middle point between the window manager
            and the desktop environment the DR0.17 is referred to as a
            "desktop shell".
