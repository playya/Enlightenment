    <div class="introduction">
        <p>What makes art with enlightenment so different than with other
            libraries, that is Edje, explain the differences between designing
            for widget sets based on edje and designing for regular widget sets
            in a easy to follow, generic way, we get to the details below.</p>

    <h3>Edje</h3>

    <div class="evas">
        <h4>Evas</h4>
        <p>Exlain shortly what evas is and how it serves for drawing everything,
            including edje that is later used for widgets. </p>

            <p>Introductory text to edje from a designer's point of view
                basically rehashing the comparisions with html/css that I made
                in the home page and the devwithedje book, among other things
                that I already wrote.</p>

        <h5>A regular application</h5>
        <p style="color:red">A regular application diagram that puts
        emphasis the need of accessing the code of the application to chage
        the design. THIS DIAGRAM IS INTENDED FOR DESIGNERS NOT DEVELOPERS</p>

    <div class="edje-app-diagram">
        <h5>An Edje based application</h5>
        <p style="color:red">An edje based aoplication diagram that shows
        the opposite of this, pretty much like I did with the Development
        With Edje book but updated. </p>

<div id="elementary">
    <h3>Elementary</h3>

    <p>I have to study elementary internals a little more
    to do write is, I want to know how much flexibility elementary gives to
    an Edje designer without requesting special code to the programmer for a
    particular applicaon.</p>

    <p>This means, an elementary widget might have certain
    restrictions when redesining it, but is it necessary to ask the developer
    to add special code for the designer to implement his widget redesign?</p>

    <p>This won't be too long as I will write the new version
    of Developement With Edje with the Evas/Edje/Elementary combo. </p>
