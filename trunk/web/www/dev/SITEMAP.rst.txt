Enlightenment.org sitemap
#########################
This is a new sitemap that I created contemplating some things written by K-S
and Raster and the fact that I found many subdomains and communities I didn't
know existed.

This sitemap consist of 7 brochure pages and a couple of wiki pages. The
**goals of this file** are:

#.  Organize the merging of the content written by raster and by me (dresb) in
    the brochure pages.
#.  Organize the relationships between the wiki and the brochure pages.
#.  Organize the wiki itself and the merging of the content in both the new and
    old wikis into this more strict structure.
#.  Explain the rationale behind each page and section of it.

In the HTML version of this file, each area surrounded by a border, like
`home`_ and `wiki.developers`_, represents either a `brochure
<Brochure Pages>`_ or `wiki <Wiki Pages>`_ page. Notes are written italized and
between "[]" or simply bold while actual stub content found in this page is
written unformatted.

Subsections like `home.developers`_ or `developers.features.performance`_
with a grey background are simply the divs (and child divs) that will exist in
the page, **ignore the layout**.

To generate the html version after editing the text file of the sitemap simply
install python's docutils and call::

    rst2html --stylesheet-path=materials/sitemap.css --embed-stylesheet \
             SITEMAP.rst.txt > SITEMAP.html

home
===============================================================================
*[Who will get here and why? Members of the community will go directly to the
subpages and pretty much ignore this page. Visitors browsing this page consist
of a combination of aspiring buddhists along with potential E17 users and
EFL developers and perhaps a CEO or two]*

*[We have to show as much of what we have (as possible) for every type of
visitors that interest us, to get them excited enough to visit the rest of the
page]* **(This page will use mostly the content I wrote in the** `dev/?/home`_
**page.)**

..  _dev/?/home: http://www.enlightenment.org/dev/?/home

home.developers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Here we get potential developers exited so we provide them with a list of
advantage for developers. Yet most of our target developers care about
graphical interfaces, as its the biggest strength of the EFL so we need to
provide developers with content directed at artists near this section]*

*[Link to the* `developers`_ *page which developers are likely to visit along
with the* `artists`_ *page linked nearby]*


home.artists
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Artists are tired of having to rely on developers for doing anything else than
widget layout. Any creative design for widgets require code. The web is
monopolizing where designers can get more power in these new fangled "web
apps". The web is our main "enemy", not the other widget sets]*

*[Artists are split in two types, thos who could care enough to learn things
like
html+css and those who will use dreamweaver+photoshop. In this section we
must atract both types by listing:]*

*   *[That Edje is not tied to code]*
*   *[That Edje is better than html+css]*
*   *[That Edje has tools for easy creation and manipulation]*

*[Then link to the*  `artists`_ *page. ]*



home.desktop
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Even if the Elightenment project has transcended the state of a Desktop Shell
project a number of visitors will be looking for the desktop shell, displaying
it near the top with some enticing graphics as screenshots of the default theme
and the best rated themes from exchange along with some text and a link to*
`desktop`_ *]*


home.news
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[A lot of people who are not familiar with E think its a dead project, a list
of
news in the home page dispell this idea, list a few articles and link to the*
`news`_ *section]*


home.planet
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Even more people think E is a Window Manager project, a list of blog posts
from
developers using the EFL in various devices and model ways is vital to dispell
this notion, a few planet posts and a link to* `planet
<http://planet.enlightenment.org/>`_
will be posted here]*


about
===============================================================================
*[Anyone looking for technical infromation would have clicked in* `developers`_
*instead. Since the only way to get here is through the header link (or google).
I think visitors to this page are more interested in the project itself its
philosphy, history and people]* **(The content will be mostly the about page
I wrote** `dev/?/about`_ **page.**

..  _dev/?/about: http://enlightenment.org/dev/?/about


about.community
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[What I wrote in the introduction of* `dev/?/about`_. *]*

*[Spiced with links the* `community`_ *page and the* `community.people`_ *anchor
in that page]*

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[What I wrote in "The Foundation Libraries" at* `dev/?/about`_ *]*

Link to `developers`_.

Link tothe `desktop`_ shell page.


about.history
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[The text "The history of the Enlightenment Project" at* `dev/?/about`_ *as it
is]*


news
===============================================================================
*[Basically a news repository for the official channel and the planet]*

news.official
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[The same rationale than the* `home.news`_ *section only with some
filters by year, month, etc. and a larger list by default]*


news.planet
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Also the same as* `home.planet`_ *with a larger numbers of news and a link to
the planet]*


developers
===============================================================================
*[This page introduces three things:]*

#.   *[The features of the EFL abstracted from the libraries, as philosphy]*
#.   *[The EFL themselves]*
#.   *[The development commmunity with a refrence to the whole community]*

*[In these three ways:]*

#.  **[Mostly the content raster wrote in the** `/?p=about`_ **page]**.
#.  *[Some short introductory texts I have written in various  places, always
    keeping the wiki as the main repository of data of course. Along with the
    lists raster introduced, spiced up a little]*
#.  *[Basically an invitation text to the community and a collection of links to
    sections inside* `community`_ *, and* `wiki.developers` *(which contains
    things like "getting started") and a link to* `about.history`_ *in case he
    cares to learn more]*

..  _/?p=about: http://www.enlightenment.org/?p=about

developers.features
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[This section consistists mostly on what raster wrote in* `/?p=about`_ *]*


developers.features.performance
...............................
*[The first paragraph of what raster wrote at "Devices" spiced up a
little to make it more performance oriented with some mentions of the speeds
of processors the efl have been used sucessfully and a mention to raster's
historical obsession with efficiency (or so he said in a video I've seen)]*


developers.features.platfrom support
.....................................
*[Both paragraphs written by raster at "Platform Support" in* `/?p=about`_ *with
the first paragraph remaining the same]*

*[The second paragraph will be spiced up a little by presenting platform support
as a community effort and by adding a link to the anchor* `wiki.efl.platforms`_
*]*


developers.features.effectiveness
..................................
*[Again what raster wrote at "Effectiveness" in* `/?p=about`_ *]*

*[Its important to add links to pages that mention the EFL in the page itslef
like* `canola2 <http://openbossa.indt.org/canola2/developer.html>`_. *This is
very important, IMO, simply linking to a page that does not mention the EFL does
little for credibility]*

*[Corporate pages rarely change, specially the urls to news releases, or if they
do they implement a redirection service so these pages would be the safest bet
to reduce mantinance of the brochure pages]*

*[Link to* `wiki.efl.devices`_ *where users can add their own links to blog
posts, articles, or whatever else where they found the EFL being used in a
device]*


developers.features.architectures
..................................
*[The rest of the text written by raster at "Devices" in* `/?p=about`_ *]*

*[Link to* `wiki.efl.architectures`_ *for user mantained architecture list
similar to devices]*


developers.features.graphics
............................
*[What raster wrote at "Graphics" in* `/?p=about`_ *]*

*[An official youtube/whatever screencast showing some Evas/Edje capabilities
would be REALLY nice here.*]



developers.introduction
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[A short introductory text to the Enlightenment Foundation Libraires, I and
others (including the introduction raster wrote in* `/?p=index`_ *and*
`/?p=about`_ *) have written these in the past and we only have to merge/edit
and paste here]*

*[This should be spiced with links to* `wiki.EnlightenmentFoundationLibraries`_
*and* `wiki.developers`_ *along with links to anchors inside those pages like*
`wiki.developers.getting started`_ *to make the contents in these wiki pages
more explicit from the start]*

.. _/?p=index: http://www.enlightenment.org/


developers.introduction.core EFL
................................
*[Basically the same list of core libs made by raster at "Building Blocks" in*
`/?p=about`_ *linking to their wiki pages spiced with a one line introduction
for each library. The last item of the list should be a link to the anchor*
`wiki.efl.all`_ *inside the EFL wiki page]*

*[Add the diagram made by raster as a float with a little more contrast by
reducing bling and shadows. The whole diagram can will be a link to*
`wiki.EnlightenmentFoundationLibraries`_ *]*


developers.introduction.bindings
................................
*[A list of the bindings that are* **fully functional today for the core libs.**
*Each with a list to their wiki page. I will have to write the non existent wiki
pages, so lets keep this list short.]*

*[At the end of the list a link to* `wiki.efl.bindings`_ *should be in place for
a user mantained list of complete and incomplete bindings with for the core
and extra libraries]*


developers.introduction.example apps
....................................
*[A list of applications similar to what raster made in the about page except we
need to use exchange for the application lists. This has several advantages:]*

*   *[We can create a dinamic list that includes screenshots, etc]*
*   *[The developer is not forced to create a full wiki page with information]*
*   *[We populate the bare application section on exchange]*

*[This will take a couple of hours to implement, at most, the hard part is
hacking exchange to add special listings for this section if we want them,
unless the exchange developer does it]*

*[Application developers who want to have a wiki page in our wiki can simply
create it and link to it from exchange page, many application developers will
prefer using their own external pages and this would work seamessly with the
already existing exchange code]*


developers.community
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[This section is very small and prety much a repository of links for
developers wanting to be part of the DEVELOPMENT community.]*

developers.community.introduction
.................................
*[It will be introduced by a paragraph that talks about the EFL community, the
way they work, the structure (or lack of thereof), the way things are planed]*

*[Basically presenting it as a small community where everyone does its own thing
and have different interestest on the embedded and desktop words. A community
that talks to eachother and is always looking for ways to combine seemengly
unrelated work efficently. A community that might seem laid back but where each
developer gets results for their areas of interest]*

*[This paragraph will be spiced with some linking to the* `about.history`_,
*and* `community`_ *pages]*

developers.community.community
..............................
*[Make clear what are the prefered methods of communication for the DEVELOPERS
among links to* `community.irc`_, `community.mailing lists`_, *and of course a
full link to* `community`_ *]*

developers.community.contribute
................................
*[An introductory paragraph about contributing to development of anything
Enlightenment related among links to* `wiki.developers.contributing`_ *and*
`community.contributing`_ *]*

*[A list of links of the main content linked from the*
`wiki.developers.contributing`_ *section will help make the content of that
page more explicit, but it might not be necessary]*

*   `wiki.Coding Style`_
*   `wiki.Code Contribution Guidelines`_
*   `wiki.Reporting Bugs`_ and `wiki.Debugging`_
*   `wiki.Translating`_
*   `wiki.Development Ideas`_
*   `wiki.developers.contributing`_


community
===============================================================================
*[This page replaces the old "contact" page, I decide to rename it community so
I could add resources that are not specifically contact information but methods
for users to contact eachother, like exchange.]*

**(I wrote the text content for the page here)**

community.irc
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The fastest way to get in touch with other users and developers of the
Enlightenment community is using the
`IRC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ channels provided by
`FreeNode <http://freenode.net/>`_. To participate simply download an
`IRC client
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients>`_,
connect to one of the
`FreeNode Servers <http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml>`_ and execute either:

*   `/join #e` - To talk to other users of the Desktop Shell or Enlightenment
    based applications.
*   `/join #edevelop` - To talk to other developers about development issues
    relating to the Desktop Shell or other Enlightenment based applications and
    libraries.


community.mailing lists
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[The classic mailing list table]*

It is also possible to contact some of the developers directly through their
mails or websites as listed in `community.people`_.


community.exchange
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
`Exchange <http://exchange.enlightenment.org/>`_ is the way theme and module
creators for the Enlightenment Desktop Shell along with stand-alone application
developers expose their work to the community. This page makes possible to
for users search, rate and comment these works.

*[Spice with a small dynamic list of 3 modules, themes and applications from
exchange, inlined, not occupying much space]*


community.external communities
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
There are several communites created around the Enlightenment project for
different reasons.

*[List of the most active (and stable) external communities like*
http://fr.enlightenment.org/ *along with a link to*
`wiki.home.communities`_ *]*


community.forum
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Will http://forum.enlightenment.org/ be retained or removed?]*


community.wiki
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This project uses the wiki provided by Trac to add user mantained documentation
and more dynamic lists of external and internal resources. To add or edit
content simply register a new
`account <http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/register>`_, take a look at the trac
wiki `help page <http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/TracWiki>`_ and you are
ready to go.

desktop
===============================================================================
*[This page is for the project's star. A lot of content about it was written
in various other pages, so we here we concentrate that content into a full
blown adverstiment, aka, images galore]*

**(I wrote the text content for the page here)**

desktop.Introduction
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Flagship application of the Enlightenment Project, The Enlightenment Desktop
Shell features flexibility comparable with the most advanced window managers
yet remains easy enough to be setup and customized by a novice user using
simple configuration dialogs.

Since the Desktop Shell also provides the best of the amenities found in full
blown Desktop Shells like Freedesktop.org standards compilance, desktop icons,
device auto-mounting, application crash management and a file management. E17
leaves the Window Manager competition behind in both functionality and ease
of use, which is the reason we call it a Desktop Shell.

Finally while its capacity of theme creation is unmatched it remains light
enough to run in embedded devices and legacy hardware.

*[Full Blown screenshot of the default theme, with the default values and
some of the best looking dialogs]*

desktop.Introduction.installation
.................................
There are four methods to install the Desktop Shell as outlined in the
`wiki.E17UserGuide`_:

*   From your offical `wiki.packages`_ created by the Enlightenment developers
    for your distribution.
*   From alternative methods provided by `wiki.guide.install.other distros`_
*   `wiki.guide.install.from source`_ using `wiki.guide.install.snapshots`_.
*   `wiki.guide.install.from source`_ using `wiki.guide.install.svn`_ directly.


desktop.Standard Compilant
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The Foundational Libraries of the Enlightenment Desktop Shell were created with
embedded device development in mind, by using portable C and common standards
it is possible to port the Enlightenment Window Manager to any system
supporting the X windowing system.

Special libraries were created specifically to support modern FreeDesktop.org
standards. Efreet allows the Desktop Shell to access and manipulate standard
menus and icons while E_Dbus deals with modern IPC mechanisms and HAL automated
device mounting.


desktop.Easy on Resources
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The libraries that make up the Enlightenment Desktop Shell have been developed
for performance since their inception for two reasons, the lead developer has
a healty obsession with efficiency and secondly many of the library developers
work with embedded devices.

As a result of using these libraries the Desktop Shell turned out quite light,
but each feature added increased resource utilization to paliate this and to
be able of using the window manager in embedded devices the developers
implemented a module system that allows you to even unload configuration
dialogs and other functionality to produce a window manager capable of running
on small phones.

*[Gallery of CUT photos of devices running illumine or a full blown E17. The
visible parts show the screen with a identificable E17 graphical feature and
links to the full photo]*


desktop.Flexibility and Ease of Use
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The Desktop Shell sports an number of configuration options rivaled only by
the most advanced Desktop Enviroments. Going from simple ahestetics, to input
devices, to complex behaviour, all of this power is at the users's reach
through simple configuration dialogs.

*[Gallery of CUT screenshots of the best configuration dialogs. The visible part
of the screenshot shows a representative part of the dialog and links to a full
shot of it]*


desktop.Beyond Window Management
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
But the reasons we call E17 a Desktop Shell are the extra features that go
beyond Window Management such as:

*   Device automounting.
*   Desktop Icons.
*   Panel and desktop gadgets.
*   File management.
*   Application Error Handling.
*   Built-in integration with the Exchange community for theme and wallpaper
    downloading.
*   *[Anything else else?]*

*[This list can be presented as a inline gallery of CUT screenshot gallery +
feature name similar to the other galleries]*


desktop.Internationalization
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The Enlightenment community has traslated the Desktop Shell to multiple
languages, to consult the status of your own language you can visit the
`Translation Release Status <http://l10n.enlightenment.org/releases/DR17/>`_
page. If you whish to collaborate be sure to visit `wiki.Translating`_.

*[Other gallery of CUT screenshots showing different languages (even
left-to-right?) that point to full shots of the languages]*


desktop.Visually Stunning
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The base libraries of the Desktop Shell were created with embedded development
in mind which often has design flexibility as a requirement to fit complex
interfaces in small screens.

The basis of this is a library named Edje, this library allows designers to
create themes using a simple language similar to what an html+css designer would
expect but many times more powerful, vistit `wiki.CreatingThemesForE17`_ and
`artists`_ to learn more about this wonderful system.

*[A list of themes form exchange.org like the ones in* `dev/?/home`_ *and*
`dev/?/desktop`_ *]*

.. _dev/?/desktop: http://enlightenment.org/dev/?/desktop


desktop.Modular
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Years ago, modules began as simple gadgets to be added into the window manager,
but as the interest on embedded devices grew and the focus of the project
shifted the module system was expanded to cover core functionality. Now its
possible to not only to manage gadgets, but to add or remove functionality and
behaviour exclusively through modules including whole configuration dialogs.

To learn more about installing and using modules visit `wiki.guide.Modules,
Shelves and Gadgets`_.

*[Dynamic list of modules from exchange.org with screenshot and module name. as
in the* `dev/?/desktop`_ *page*]


artists
===============================================================================
This page continues the idea of the `home.artists`_ section and follows the
pattern of `wiki.EdjeBasics`_ but from a promotinal focus.

**(I wrote the text content for the page here)**

artists.edje
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Edje is a simple declarative language such as CSS, but much more powerful, is
not tied to markup or programming. Edje can be used to dictate the design of
the interface from the top down, to simply style a given element, or both.

Applications use it in different manners, embedded applications tend to use it
directly to create their own widgets albeit lately more applications are using
Edje accompained with `wiki.Elementary`_. A widget set designed by the
same person who created Edje specifically to complement eachother.

You can find an introductory guide to Edje in `wiki.EdjeBasics`_.

artists.edje.structure
......................
For an application the result of including an Edje files is obtaining a
collection of objects. These objects, from the designer point of views are
groups composition of other, more primitive, objects like images, out of reach
of the developer except on special cases.

You can learn about the complete file structure and how to manipulate these
files in `wiki.edje.FileStructure`_.

*[A small snippet of Edje code showing the collection , group, part,
description structure (minimized) floating next to the text]*

artists.edje.size and positioning
.................................
In Edje every object created by the designer has a container. The relationship
of the container and the object varies depending on the type of object created.
Still, we know that the method to manipulate this container, and the behaviour
of the contained object as a result, is always consistent.

We use containers to manage the size and position of object. But the feature
that puts Edje over every other system of its type is that the size and location
of the container can be setup relatively to another container. As a result, we
can create complex interfaces that scale seamessly in different screen sizes.

You can learn more about it in `wiki.edje.SizeAndPositioning`_.

*[code snipet of rel1, rel2 floating next to the text]*

artists.edje.transitions
.........................
Normally, complex interface transitions and animations are in the realm of
programmers. Thanks to Edje's description system coupled with pre-programmed
transition mechanisms it is possible to change every property of an object and
turn this difference of values into an animation without a line of programming.

The transition system makes possible to animate any kind of change from simple
ahestetic changes like altering background colors to sizes, position,
visibility in various ways and speeds at the designer's discretion.

You can learn more about it in `wiki.edje.AnimationsAndTransitions`_.

*[A small snippet of Edje code showing a small Edje program. Floating
along text]*


artists.tools
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For those who don't want to write the Edje source files from scratch. The
Enlightenment project is commited to provide the best graphical tools
possible for potential designers, although some are under developement, a
varied ecosystem of applications and utilities exist.

*   *[LinkToExchange: Edje Editor or Editje, only one of them]*

wiki.developers
===============================================================================
You might be interested on developing either the Desktop Shell or applications
based on the Foundation Libraries. While there might be differences between
most of them (for example E17 does not use `wiki.Elementary`_ but its own widget
set) we tried to give this page a more generic approach and provide more
specific information in the developers area of

wiki.artists
===============================================================================
Being an artists Enlightenment project means being familiar with Edje since it
will be used as a base for themeing regardless of the type of application
developed.

wiki.artists.documentation
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Right now there is not a complete and updated manual for designing Edje themes,
the language itself is simple and many designers might find browsing the
source of decompiled themes in `wiki.artists.resources`_ will be enough to get
themselves started. Other resources include:

*   The automatically generated `EDC Refrence
    <http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/edje/edcref.html>`_.
*   The slightly outdated `Edje Book
    <http://docs.enlightenment.org/books/edjebook/edjebook.pdf>`_
*   The small introduction to `wiki.EdjeBasics`_ found in this wiki.


wiki.artists.tools
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[List of links to Editje (and the Edje Editor?), the Edje Viewer, The SVG to
Edje script, the gimp to edje script (it exists?) Even when right now the
contents of this section and the brochure page coincide this section.]*

wiki.artists.resources
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*[Links to Enlightenment design resources like the color pallette and the SVG
versions of the logo along with links to themes that have their code and
images under free licenses, specially the tutorial-like new default theme.]*



wiki.EnlightenmentDesktopShell
===============================================================================
*[Link repository for uses and developers interested in E17]*

wiki.desktop.install
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Link to `wiki.guide.install`_ along with a list of links to the sections on
thepage to make clear the ways of installation from the start.

*   `wiki.guide.install.packages`_
*   `wiki.guide.install.from source`_

wiki.desktop.contributing
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Users can contribute to the Desktop Shell project in many ways, including:

*   `wiki.Reporting Bugs`_
*   `wiki.Translating`_
*   `wiki.CreatingThemesForE17`_


wiki.desktop.developers
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As a developer you will not find many differences in contributing to the
Enlightenment Desktop Shell and other Enlightenment based projects. You can
find a more generic approach to contribution in `wiki.developers.contributing`_
while we will outline E17 specifics in this page.

wiki.desktop.developers.introduction
....................................
*[Explain the differences between the approach of e17 and the rest of the EFL
apps]*

wiki.desktop.developers.tutorials

wiki.E17UserGuide
===============================================================================
*[A simpler, smaller version of the old user guide that takes from the older
user guide and discards all the unnecessary content like dialogs explanations.
If you need a user guide to explain what a dialog does the dialog is badly
designed and should be fixed or a help text/system should be added to the dialog
itself.]*

wiki.guide.install
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
There are various ways to install E17 in this section you will find them ordered
from easier to harder.

wiki.guide.install.packages
...........................
You can find out if your distribution is supported by our packaging system
by visiting the `wiki.packages`_ page. If it isn't list of distributions that
have an official or unoficial method to install E17 with external links, do
not dwelve into details for the distribution here, that's the distribution's
wiki job.

wiki.guide.install.other distros
................................
You can find guides for distributions not supported by the Enlightenment project
that have their own packages and installation methods.

*   `Arch Linux <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/E17>`_
*   `Gentoo Linux <http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/E17>`_
*   *[Add your own]*

wiki.guide.install.from source
..............................
*[Explain the necessary external depenencies for e17 with instructions to
install them in the most popular distros (basically a one line command),
distributions with complex instructions should work on their own wiki.]*

wiki.guide.install.snapshots
............................
*[Provide a <pre> to download every latest snapshot in one go in the correct
order and another <pre> to be applied to each tarball in the same order
including decompressing and compiling.]*

wiki.guide.install.svn
......................
*[Refer to the* `wiki.svn`_ *page to explain how to use SVN in this section
simply paste the commands to get the source in a <pre> in the correct order and
then the commands necessary to compile in another <pre> explaining that the same
order should be followed.]*

wiki.guide.Modules, Shelves and Gadgets
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

wiki.guide.modules
..................
Modules are basically small C programs that can be loaded at runtime by the
Desktop Shell and can be used to provide anything from simple Desktop Gadgets
to alter core functionality of E17 such as implementing a tiling window
manager.

wiki.guide.shelves
..................
*[Shelves are a type of module continer..etc...etc...etc...]*

wiki.guide.gadgets
..................
*[The Gadgets module allows to load certain (or all) modules directly to the
desktop without using a shelf..etc...etc...etc...]*

wiki.guide.getting modules
..........................
The window manager itself bundles a selection of modules but there are many
stable modules in the `extra modules folder
<http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk/E-MODULES-EXTRA>`_ in the
official SVN tree.

Most distributions that package E17 will bundle the extra modules in a package
as well. If you installed E17 using that method your distribution's package
manager should be your first choice.

You can find modules from third parties on the `exchange website
<http://exchange.enlightenment.org>`_ normally the exchange entry will include
the installation procedure. If it doesn't the module will normally follow the
standard installation procedure.

wiki.guide.compiling modules
............................
*[to compile a module you will need the same development packages required to
compile e17 from scratch]*

*[generic instructions to compile modules including getting them from svn, all
as a regular user]*


wiki.guide.themes
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Themes can be used to alter the look of your Desktop Shell as a group or you
can alter the look of certain parts of the the desktop using different themes.
You can find themes in *[link to the "Full Themes" theme group]* in exchange.

*[To install the theme simply download the file and save it into...etc...
etc...etc...]*

Advanced Theme Usage
....................
*[Explain how to set the different styles from different themes to different
elements with some screenshot to the advanced dialog.]*

wiki.EdjeBasics
===============
I will write this, in fact, I already wrote most of it on the old wiki, I will
simply copy, paste and rewrite some of it. Images included. The content will
be basic and straightfoward.  Link to the `EDC Refrence
<http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/edje/edcref.html>`_.

*[I want to keep this simple because I'm already working on a much better guide
as a book named "A Visual Guide to Edje" inspired by the formats of books like
"Thinking with type" and "Geometry of design"]*

*[Very graphical in nature, were I start from the very basics and using graphics
and a few paragraphs of text and transition slowly into more complex matters
with the text and graphics transitioning slowly along the way]*

*[This book will be a great help for those who want to write Edje from scratch
or want to know what happen behind the scences when they use a graphical
designer]*

*[Getting the default theme from svn or decompiling and existing theme]*
*[Editing the content]*

function calls or something written by hand, we used to have this and is
invaluable for anyone seriously considering making a complete theme from
scratch]*
