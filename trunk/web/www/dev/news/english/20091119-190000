Since now a few  days, the Enlightenment Foundation Library are running on
around 2 or 3 millions French set top box. Free.fr is openning the development
on the Freebox HD by using a combination of the EFL and Mozilla JavaScript
library. This open with a relatively old hardware some great graphical
possibility. Free.fr is planning to open some kind of store for this JavaScript
apps during the beginning of 2010.

So what does this mean for you as users and developers? It means that the EFL
are able to provide some eye candy with limited hardware and this target is
here to stay for some time. In the past, Freebox S.A.S as provided code that
improve some specific bottleneck of the EFL, and will continue in the futur.
We focus on 720p output, 1080p is also supported. Finally we are also working
on keyboard issue and some library will see improvement in a near futur, so
stay tunned on this too !

Of course, we are staying close to Enlightenment SVN and we are continuously
integrating our work in current SVN, so people can watch and help to see what
they want in it.
