<p>
The snapshot release of Eina, Evas, Ecore, Embryo, Edje, E_Dbus, Efreet,
Enlightenment and Elementary includes lots of improvements and fixes. Too many
to put here, but these are not considered stable yet, and thus we don't track
changelogs. They do impose soname changes and module versioning now to make
packaging cleaner alongside SVN source installs. Please download, try and test
these.
