After a long time between updates because of broken doxygen on SourceForge,
the API documentation has been updated. If you are interested in getting started with EWL,
the updated docs are an excellent reference. The test application also includes a series of tutorials
for some of the more commonly used widgets, and while the EWL book is a little outdated, the concepts
are still solid.
