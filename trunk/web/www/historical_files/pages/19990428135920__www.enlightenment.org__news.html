<p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">1999/04/13<br>
<font size="+1">Development status</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Well now we've had enough of the 0.15 series 0.16 development
should be in full swing. Now to stuff you all like to hear... what's being
done.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">First - Mandrake is actually back and coding again - so hopefully E
development won't be almost primarily a one-man-band anymore.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">And now to what's being done. Mandrake is working on adding LOTS of commands
to IPC - also adding http stuff to E so it can look at http stuff - this is
also tied in with autoupgrade - a feature that will (if enabled) allow E to
automatically inform you of bugfixes, patches, updates, new versions etc.
when they happen, by checking official pages and their contents and informing
you of it. All in the name of more user friendliness. Of course this will
only work if you are on the 'net, and only if you enable it.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">As for me - I've added a complete pager system to E with Drag and Drop
functionality - zooming miniatures of windows, also non shapshot mode, with
optional anti-aliased high-quality snapshotting resizablity, movability by
the user, And all the rest you'd expect. I've done some fixing here and
there too - added some little things that I've already forgotten what they
were... I'm considering making BrushedMetal the default theme... I think
Tigert did an amazingly good job on it.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">Also last weekend I added the start of a widget table packer into the
dialogs and some widgets to be packed - label, button, checkbutton,
radiobutton, image and separator widgets are all done and work.. and if you
check E's root menu you'll find a submenu now "Settings" that has all the
settings dialogs spawned when you select them - it's not all done yet - but
it's a demonstration of what's happening. Basically you will be able to
configure much of E form within E itself - since I need these widgets anyway
for the functionality of E - I'm recycling them to do configuration too -
infact thats the first use for them. I also plan on adding scrolled windows
(containers) to the widget collection and then I'll redo the iconification
thing to use an icon box that has lots of configuration options.. :) then
I'll look at redoing a lot of the dock app support stuff too.... add more
mini widgets to E.. and just make it better.. then fix all the little bugs
that appear.. and then release again.. :)
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">I'm also looking at doing basic file maanagement support in E - this will
probably have to wait till the above stuff is done and solidified a bit - it
will need some of the widgets from the above work... :)
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">1999/04/05<br>
<font size="+1">E 0.15.5 patchlevel is out!</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Well 0.15.5 is out - this will be the last patchlevel release
for 0.15 (hopefully) so we can get right into 0.16 features... (and for those
pining for the pager - it's not turned on in this release because it's a
0.16 fetaure and doesnt belong in 0.15.* - you'll need to stick to CVS to
get it to go). This should fix all those last lingering problems (I hope) and
should have this all usable and working.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">1999/03/17<br>
<font size="+1">E 0.15.4 patchlevel release is out</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Mandrake)</b> well - let's try to slow these releases down just a bit.  I 
think that most of the potentially bad bugs are gone now.  this release will 
fix a potential crash with translucent move mode, as well as the 
resizing of shaped and borderless windows.  Hopefully I can stop fixing bugs
and relax for a couple of days while my friend is in town.  
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/3/15<br>
<font size="+1">E 0.15.3 is OUT!!!</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Yet another release - this one fixes a segfault problem
again.. with xeyes and other "don't take focus" clients. Also fixes a manual
placement bug as well as alt-button-binding stuff when in click-to-focus :)
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/3/14<br>
<font size="+1">E 0.15.2 is OUT!!!</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> And again.. another patchlevel - this shoudl fix a minor
problem with "double clicking on the root window to brign up menus with
middle mouse" :)
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/3/13<br>
<font size="+1">E 0.15.1 is OUT!!!</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Well asexpected.. it was inevitable... 0.15.1 patchlevel is
out... it fixes accidentaal deletion of alreaday untarred themes that don't 
pass the sanity test, fixes a 64-bit architecture problem (due to screwed X
headers), fixes alt-right mouse on windows to actually keep the menu up, and
the mouse click not working after a menu is selected sometimes problem. Also
the docs have some more meat to them.
</font></p><p>
</p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/3/12<br>
<font size="+1">E 0.15 is OUT!!!</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Finally it's out. This isn't the end of E development.
It's just a stage of development... but a usable stage. You can all
try it out and play.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/2/3<br>
<font size="+1">New GUI Config tool...</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> There is now e-conf available for standalone-build. It
requires gnome but will run by itself in a window if run standalone (run
e-conf) - there are rpm's of e-conf and needed rpms and source tarballs of
all these too in 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990428135920/ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/">
ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/</a>. e-conf is what
you want. Play with it and enjoy - PLEASE NOTE. It is NOT finished. 
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/1/27<br>
<font size="+1">Snap should fix things...</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Well after a focus bug fiasco I think I spotted it whilst
rummaging some of the focus code... and I think I fixed it. The current
(today's) snap SHOULD fix this. Also are some other fixes. Yes I know
unsticking a sticky window will drop it back to its original desktop not the
current one - I'll look into that next. For now enjoy the new snaps.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/1/20<br>
<font size="+1">More snaps...</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> More daily snaps went up today with several bug fixes,
cleanups and some optimisations even. x86 rpms, src rpm's and tarballs are
available from
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990428135920/ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/">
ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/</a>. Have fun.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/1/15<br>
<font size="+1">Keep the reports rolling</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> Thankyou for the bug reports / patches I've recieved sofar -
it's great. I may be a bit quiet in replying to mail - I'm just not able to
keep up, so if you haven't gotten a reply it's probably because i simply
cannto find the time to reply to every piece of mail I get - but I do read
them and any bug reports and those that are important are put on my ever
growing list.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">There was no snapshot of E yesterday primarily because the CVS server was
down for maintinence for the day. There won't be any more snaps after today
till next monday or tuesday, so please take note.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/1/10<br>
<font size="+1">E is still kicking...</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> It's about time. daily snaps will keep going - as they are
but I'd like people who know how to use gdb and send patches to download
them and test them - if you have a problem 
<a href="mailto:raster@rasterman.com">mail me at raster@rasterman.com</a> with
all the details you can.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">If you haven't guessed - this is part of a leadup to a 0.15 release. I don't
want ugly bugs in 0.15 - I want it to be a fast, stable, usable version
people can rely on for quite a qhile whilst 0.16 development happens.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">This means of course 0.15 release is coming - basically when I'm through my
small slew of features to add/fix and some of the default config to cleanup
it's into deep freeze where all I do is find bugs and fix - I want to begin
that now in tandem so I get all the reports I can and all the patches I can.
When I believe there isn't anything left to be found and fixed, it's release
time.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">99/1/9<br>
<font size="+1">Daily snaps easier to install</font></font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2"><b>(Raster)</b> as of 2 days ago I started doing daily snaps by hand -
that means "make dist". It means you do not need automake, autoconf etc. to
install E.
</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">Go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990428135920/ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/">

latest file. Files are in the format:

</font></p><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">Where date is YYMMDD (Year, Month, Day). To install these snapshots all you
need to do is (for example)

is done.

<font face="helvetica" size="2">Eterm and Project Resurrection have both entered the GNOME CVS repository.  Eterm is now sporting a
pseudo-transparency option and selectable shading tint for a better contrast for text.  
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990428135920/http://technoir.nethead.org/Enlightenment/download.html">Technoir's Nethead</a> and

are also hosting snapshots.</font></p><p>

<font face="helvetica" size="2">Enlightenment E15-CVS itself has developed a few new features and hints at a very rich feature set for
its official unveiling.  Iconisation now has the beginnings of some Icon bounding box, and docking
organization code, better restart states, as well as tooltips.  While these are currently somewhat vestigal,
Raster and Mandrake are probably pushing to put them <strong>all</strong> in the official E15 release.
And last but not least, for our BSD friends and boxes, E15 promises to be downright friendly to your
compilers.

<font face="helvetica" size="2">The latest news is that iconisation is now relatively complete, the archive itself has shrunk dramatically
due to a culling of the less viable TrueType fonts, and a new set of window borders that deal specifically with
X terminals are in the default theme.  While less "dramatic", Raster has been spending most of the last weekend
cleaning up the code, making it more efficient, and putting on his "Bughunter" cap to see if it still fits. [grins]

the filesize has jumped to an incredible whopping 5MB!  The reason?  A bundled assortment of TrueType fonts that
you can use from within Enlightenment for spicing up those windows.  Also new in CVS: Iconisation and the beginnings of a

distinct rise in new themes soon... Oh, and Technoir has made the
