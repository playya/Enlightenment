<h3>What is Enlightenment?</h3>

<font face="helvetica">
Enlightenment is a 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981203013912/http://www.plig.org/xwinman/" target="_top">Window Manager</a> 
for the 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981203013912/http://www.x.org/" target="_top">X Windowing System</a> 
(a GUI system that runs over unix).  It is written on a very
simple premise - the user should maintain control of his desktop at 
all times.
</font><p><font face="helvetica">
Why should you have to change window managers every few weeks when you 
need some new feature?  You should be able to embed 
the feature into it or be able to find someone else who can or has 
already done so. The exact look and feel of your desktop should be left 
to you, given an infinite number of options from a highly customizable definition language.
</font></p><p><font face="helvetica">
Everything from simple backgrounds to the multiple 
border decoration styles surrounding the various windows on your desktop
can be defined and modified until you are satisfied with
its graphical layout and behaviour.  No other window manager
offers you this amount or kind of possibility without throwing all 
concern for speed and consistency out the window.  Enlightenment has 
been written completely from scratch, <strong>twice</strong>.  
Thus it is heir to none of the code many other window managers have
taken from the venerable FVWM, nor any of its inhereited limitations.
</font></p><p>

</p><h3>A note to those whose interest was perked</h3>

<font face="helvetica">
You should be aware at this point that Enlightenment is 
experimental and still in a development cycle.  
It has come along way since the early
FVWM-xpm days (having been rewritten entirely from scratch as of 0.1)
but we aren't satisfied enough with it yet to declare a 1.0 release.  If
you're not ready to tackle with your box on occasion or have the rules of
the game turned over a few times, occasionally see big huge and nasty bugs,
or have to cope with your system occasionally cutting out on you, then 
Enlightenment isn't for you (yet - remember we're still in ALPHA here!). 
</font><p><font face="helvetica">
However, if you're like me and live on your PC, and CRAVE 
for your desktop
to do the things YOU want it to do and LOOK how YOU want it to look,
I don't know how you can go to the extreme more than with
Enlightenment.  By the time we've reached 1.0, you'll never be able to look
at another window manager or GUI the same way.
</font></p><p><font face="helvetica">
Enlightenment is available for download from our  
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981203013912/http://www.enlightenment.org/download.html">download page</a>, 
so go there to snag anything you need.</font>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Copyright and Free Software</h3>

<font face="helvetica">
Enlightenment is copyrighted by their respective owners under the 
GNU GPL. If you don't believe in free software now, then you ought 
to.  Because it works. Because it makes things happen. Because if it 
wasn't for free
software, you wouldn't even have any of this cool stuff to play with in
the first place. E is freeware and the authors do not take any
responsibility for your computer growing limbs and mutilating cattle in
your neighborhood nor anything else that could happen as a result of
the installation and/or usage of the software (unless it happens to make 
you popular or rich and famous, in which case we have no problem taking all
the credit and anything that comes from it).
