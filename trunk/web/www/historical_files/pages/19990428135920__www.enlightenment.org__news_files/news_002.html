<font size=+1>Development status</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Well now we've had enough of the 0.15 series 0.16 development
should be in full swing. Now to stuff you all like to hear... what's being
done.
<p>
First - Mandrake is actually back and coding again - so hopefully E
development won't be almost primarily a one-man-band anymore.
<p>
And now to what's being done. Mandrake is working on adding LOTS of commands
to IPC - also adding http stuff to E so it can look at http stuff - this is
also tied in with autoupgrade - a feature that will (if enabled) allow E to
automatically inform you of bugfixes, patches, updates, new versions etc.
when they happen, by checking official pages and their contents and informing
you of it. All in the name of more user friendliness. Of course this will
only work if you are on the 'net, and only if you enable it.
<p>
As for me - I've added a complete pager system to E with Drag and Drop
functionality - zooming miniatures of windows, also non shapshot mode, with
optional anti-aliased high-quality snapshotting resizablity, movability by
the user, And all the rest you'd expect. I've done some fixing here and
there too - added some little things that I've already forgotten what they
were... I'm considering making BrushedMetal the default theme... I think
Tigert did an amazingly good job on it.
<p>
Also last weekend I added the start of a widget table packer into the
dialogs and some widgets to be packed - label, button, checkbutton,
radiobutton, image and separator widgets are all done and work.. and if you
check E's root menu you'll find a submenu now "Settings" that has all the
settings dialogs spawned when you select them - it's not all done yet - but
it's a demonstration of what's happening. Basically you will be able to
configure much of E form within E itself - since I need these widgets anyway
for the functionality of E - I'm recycling them to do configuration too -
infact thats the first use for them. I also plan on adding scrolled windows
(containers) to the widget collection and then I'll redo the iconification
thing to use an icon box that has lots of configuration options.. :) then
I'll look at redoing a lot of the dock app support stuff too.... add more
mini widgets to E.. and just make it better.. then fix all the little bugs
that appear.. and then release again.. :)
<p>
I'm also looking at doing basic file maanagement support in E - this will
probably have to wait till the above stuff is done and solidified a bit - it
will need some of the widgets from the above work... :)
<p>
1999/04/05<br>
<font size=+1>E 0.15.5 patchlevel is out!</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Well 0.15.5 is out - this will be the last patchlevel release
for 0.15 (hopefully) so we can get right into 0.16 features... (and for those
pining for the pager - it's not turned on in this release because it's a
0.16 fetaure and doesnt belong in 0.15.* - you'll need to stick to CVS to
get it to go). This should fix all those last lingering problems (I hope) and
should have this all usable and working.
<p>
1999/03/17<br>
<font size=+1>E 0.15.4 patchlevel release is out</font><p>
<b>(Mandrake)</b> well - let's try to slow these releases down just a bit.  I 
think that most of the potentially bad bugs are gone now.  this release will 
fix a potential crash with translucent move mode, as well as the 
resizing of shaped and borderless windows.  Hopefully I can stop fixing bugs
and relax for a couple of days while my friend is in town.  
<p>
99/3/15<br>
<font size=+1>E 0.15.3 is OUT!!!</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Yet another release - this one fixes a segfault problem
again.. with xeyes and other "don't take focus" clients. Also fixes a manual
placement bug as well as alt-button-binding stuff when in click-to-focus :)
<p>
99/3/14<br>
<font size=+1>E 0.15.2 is OUT!!!</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> And again.. another patchlevel - this shoudl fix a minor
problem with "double clicking on the root window to brign up menus with
middle mouse" :)
<p>
99/3/13<br>
<font size=+1>E 0.15.1 is OUT!!!</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Well asexpected.. it was inevitable... 0.15.1 patchlevel is
out... it fixes accidentaal deletion of alreaday untarred themes that don't 
pass the sanity test, fixes a 64-bit architecture problem (due to screwed X
headers), fixes alt-right mouse on windows to actually keep the menu up, and
the mouse click not working after a menu is selected sometimes problem. Also
the docs have some more meat to them.
<p>
<p>
99/3/12<br>
<font size=+1>E 0.15 is OUT!!!</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Finally it's out. This isn't the end of E development.
It's just a stage of development... but a usable stage. You can all
try it out and play.
<p>
99/2/3<br>
<font size=+1>New GUI Config tool...</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> There is now e-conf available for standalone-build. It
requires gnome but will run by itself in a window if run standalone (run
e-conf) - there are rpm's of e-conf and needed rpms and source tarballs of
all these too in 
<a href=ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/>
ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/</a>. e-conf is what
you want. Play with it and enjoy - PLEASE NOTE. It is NOT finished. 
<p>
99/1/27<br>
<font size=+1>Snap should fix things...</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Well after a focus bug fiasco I think I spotted it whilst
rummaging some of the focus code... and I think I fixed it. The current
(today's) snap SHOULD fix this. Also are some other fixes. Yes I know
unsticking a sticky window will drop it back to its original desktop not the
current one - I'll look into that next. For now enjoy the new snaps.
<p>
99/1/20<br>
<font size=+1>More snaps...</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> More daily snaps went up today with several bug fixes,
cleanups and some optimisations even. x86 rpms, src rpm's and tarballs are
available from
<a href=ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/>
ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/</a>. Have fun.
<p>
99/1/15<br>
<font size=+1>Keep the reports rolling</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> Thankyou for the bug reports / patches I've recieved sofar -
it's great. I may be a bit quiet in replying to mail - I'm just not able to
keep up, so if you haven't gotten a reply it's probably because i simply
cannto find the time to reply to every piece of mail I get - but I do read
them and any bug reports and those that are important are put on my ever
growing list.
<p>
There was no snapshot of E yesterday primarily because the CVS server was
down for maintinence for the day. There won't be any more snaps after today
till next monday or tuesday, so please take note.
<p>
99/1/10<br>
<font size=+1>E is still kicking...</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> It's about time. daily snaps will keep going - as they are
but I'd like people who know how to use gdb and send patches to download
them and test them - if you have a problem 
<a href=mailto:raster@rasterman.com>mail me at raster@rasterman.com</a> with
all the details you can.
<p>
If you haven't guessed - this is part of a leadup to a 0.15 release. I don't
want ugly bugs in 0.15 - I want it to be a fast, stable, usable version
people can rely on for quite a qhile whilst 0.16 development happens.
<p>
This means of course 0.15 release is coming - basically when I'm through my
small slew of features to add/fix and some of the default config to cleanup
it's into deep freeze where all I do is find bugs and fix - I want to begin
that now in tandem so I get all the reports I can and all the patches I can.
When I believe there isn't anything left to be found and fixed, it's release
time.
<p>
99/1/9<br>
<font size=+1>Daily snaps easier to install</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> as of 2 days ago I started doing daily snaps by hand -
that means "make dist". It means you do not need automake, autoconf etc. to
install E.
<p>
Go to <a href=ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/>
ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/</a> and get the
latest file. Files are in the format:
<p>
filename-version-date.tar.gz
<p>
Where date is YYMMDD (Year, Month, Day). To install these snapshots all you
need to do is (for example)
<p>
~/ mv enlightenment-0.15.0-990109.tar.gz /tmp<br>
~/ su -<br>
Password:<br>
/home/user # cd /tmp<br>
/tmp/ # tar zxvf enlightenment-0.15.0-990109.tar.gz<br>
/tmp/ # cd enlightenment-0.15.0<br>
/tmp/ # ./configure --prefix=/usr<br>
/tmp/ # make install<br>
<p>
99/1/7<br>
<font size=+1>Server down and depreciated</font><p>
<b>(Raster)</b> It seems like <b>ftp.enlightenment.org</b> (which is Mandrake's
machine) has been brought down. The machine is alive but all network
services have been disabled. I have no control over this. The reason for
downage is still unknown at this point.
<p>
As a result all links have been changed and all services are now running off
the original <b>www.rasterman.com</b>. Use <a href=http://www.rasterman.com>
http://www.rasterman.com</a> for the web page for Enlightenment and
<a href=ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment>
ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment</a> as the location for FTP for
Enlightenment from now on.
<p>
98/12/13<br>
<font size=+1>New Look Online</font><p>
After much procrastination - a new look hit the streets - should be easier to
read and more pleasing on the eyes. E 0.15 is coming along and moving to
tying up all the lose ends getting read for a release just as soon as that
is done.

<p>
98/11/14<br>
<font size=+1>Site Overhaul Soon</font><p>

The online documentation has a slight face lift, although this is only a first step towards a
reorganisation of its structure.  The rest of the website will soon have another look as well.
The plan is a new aesthetic, and a hopefully a better functionality in serving your needs.

<p>

<font size=+1>Debian CVS snapshots</font><p>

Since Shaleh has stepped down, Brian Almeida (the User Formerly Known As Tynian :)  has taken over as the 
uber-E maintainer and has made available 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~bma/e-cvs/debs/">Debian snapshots</a> of CVS E15 
 for those of you of the Debian persuasion hunting for a bit of fun.  Llibra 
will purportedly be taken on as official E maintainer Real Soon Now.

<p>98/10/20<br>
<font size="+1">Press Interview</font><p>

<a href="http://www.linuxpower.org/display_item.phtml?id=69">Linux Power</a> has an interview online concerning
Raster's and Mandrake's plans for Enlightenment. Also appearing in the
interview is Technoir, best known for piecing together Hand of God, and putting together an centralised theme
repository, whom most of you probably know from the IRC channel #E.  Announcements and conversation about this is also
online at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>.  It also has a nice summary of the features now under
development in CVS, which will be released as E15.  Root Menus, Tooltips, and Icon containers are slated to be
complete with this release.

<p>

98/09/23<br>
<font size="+1">E.Themes.Org Now Online</font><p>

<a href="http://themes.org/">Themes.Org</a> now has an 
<a href="http://e.themes.org/">Enlightenment section</a> online.  They promise to be both a 
repository of Enlightenment themes, general pointers to everything, and possibly a knowledge bank.
They host a message board for the users, just like Technoir's Nethead used to, which is replaced
by this resource.  Congratulations to Technoir and Keebler, the co-maintainers!  Visit them and
show your support for their efforts.

<p>
98/09/14<br>
<font size="+1">One-Stop World Domination Tour</font><p>

The Enlightenment development team are going to appear at the Atlanta Linux Showcase
and rock the house with all of your other favourite speakers and exhibits looking on.
They will be demoing Enlightenment, and explaining the mysteries of philosophy that make it
up, as well as showing you some of the Higher Mysteries of achieving Enlightenment.

<p>

You can scarf 
<a href="https://als.ale.org/registration/als-register?attendee">tickets online now</a>
.  They're $35US for students, and $60US for everybody else.
You've seen the code, and now you can press the flesh and maybe give Mandrake that Bass
Ale he's always talking about.  Our boys' declaration of conquest can be 
<a href="http://www.ale.org/showcase/speaker/speakers.shtml#enlight">found there too</a>.

<p>98/09/08<br>
<font size="+1">E15 CVS Watch</font><p>

Eterm and Project Resurrection have both entered the GNOME CVS repository.  Eterm is now sporting a
pseudo-transparency option and selectable shading tint for a better contrast for text.  
<a href="http://technoir.nethead.org/Enlightenment/download.html">Technoir's Nethead</a> and  
<a href="ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/">the official E mirrors</a> 
are also hosting snapshots.<p>

Enlightenment E15-CVS itself has developed a few new features and hints at a very rich feature set for
its official unveiling.  Iconisation now has the beginnings of some Icon bounding box, and docking
organization code, better restart states, as well as tooltips.  While these are currently somewhat vestigal,
Raster and Mandrake are probably pushing to put them <strong>all</strong> in the official E15 release.
And last but not least, for our BSD friends and boxes, E15 promises to be downright friendly to your
compilers.

<p>

98/08/25<br>
<font size="+1">E15 CVS Watch</font><p>

The latest news is that iconisation is now relatively complete, the archive itself has shrunk dramatically
due to a culling of the less viable TrueType fonts, and a new set of window borders that deal specifically with
X terminals are in the default theme.  While less "dramatic", Raster has been spending most of the last weekend
cleaning up the code, making it more efficient, and putting on his "Bughunter" cap to see if it still fits. [grins]
<p>

98/08/13<br>
<font size="+1">E15 CVS Watch</font><p>

For those of you who partake of the virtues of the 
<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/">GNOME CVS repository</a>, 
or of the latest Enlightenment 
<a href="ftp://www.rasterman.com/pub/enlightenment/daily-snaps/">snapshots</a>,
the filesize has jumped to an incredible whopping 5MB!  The reason?  A bundled assortment of TrueType fonts that
you can use from within Enlightenment for spicing up those windows.  Also new in CVS: Iconisation and the beginnings of a
docking unit for WindowMaker apps.  I think we are going to be seeing a
distinct rise in new themes soon... Oh, and Technoir has made the 
<a href="http://technoir.nethead.org/Enlightenment/cvs/ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a> 
available for us.
<p>

98/08/13<br>
<font size="+1">Documentation Online</font><p>

We have new <a href="/documentation/index.html">online documentation</a> for Enlightenment 14.  It's a FAQ, but it also has aspirations 
of  being comprehensive.  If you've had problems installing, compiling, or using Enlightenment, this will be the
resource for you.  Czech it out, watch it grow daily!
<p>

98/07/01<br>
<font size="+1">Enlightenment 0.14.0 Release</font><p>

The long awaited release of the 14th development cycle has  
<a href="download.html">hit the net!</a>  Grab it while it's still too hot to eat!

<p>
For those who think that the latest release will be less stable than the previous
versions... try it out and see.
