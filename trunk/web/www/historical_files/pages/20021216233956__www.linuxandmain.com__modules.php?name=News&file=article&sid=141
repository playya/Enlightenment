<font class="content"><b><i>There are a few genuine legends in the Linux community, and among
them is an Aussie named Carsten Haitzler. Who? That's right -- the name
probably means nothing to you. but his </i>nom de code<i> inspires awe
in many. He is The Rasterman, and for many years he has been the symbol
of innovative, uncompromising excellence in pushing the potential of the
Linux desktop to and past its limits. He is the founder, though
"inventor" would not be too strong a word, of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021216233956/http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/main.html">Enlightenment</a>
project, an infinitely configurable window manager that is working its
way toward becoming a desktop, even though he thinks the desktop battle is lost. In an email interview, he
talks about what he's doing, his view of the future of desktop Linux,
the nature of development projects -- commercial, community-based, and
genius-based -- and much more.</i></b><br><br></font><p><font class="content"><b>Linux and Main:</b> What are you doing nowadays?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>The Rasterman:</b> I'm in Sydney now. I'm working for a small
contracting firm here working on Linux embedded-related stuff.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b>&nbsp;We saw a report a year or so ago that described a
talk and &nbsp;demonstration you gave. The report was written in awed tones
-- as if the writer could not find the words to describe what he'd seen, but 
that it was clearly the future. What new areas have you been exploring?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Embedded display systems using a canvas API. Basically... EVAS. :) it was
written at first to help build efm and subsequently e 0.17 (still being worked
on) and it's growing up to be even bigger than I had imagined in its
scope. The new evas codebase is tiny (191kb compiled for arm), handles X
and the Linux framebuffer (more display targets coming) is lean on RAM,
fast, and easy to use... more will come from this - but there's barely
space here to start describing.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> At about the same time, there was a rumor that you and
Daniel M. Duley, known to many as Mosfet, were discussing some kind of
collaborative effort. Anything to it?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> I'm a bit vague on my memory. Daniel is a good bloke and does lots of good stuff
for KDE &amp; themes. Can't recall though - anything more specific to jog my
brain?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><i>[Note: There was nothing beyond the rumor, so no additional
details to provide.]</i></font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> As you look at the graphical desktops for Linux other than 
Enlightenment, do you think they're growing in the right directions?
What are the best things you find in projects like KDE and GNOME? Where
do they most fall short?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> KDE, I think, are doing a good job. GNOME are behind but
look a bit nicer (still) thanks a lot to good artwork :). I've stopped
paying attention really to the "desktop war," though. I tend to not keep
much track as I just use my own stuff all the time.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that
resembles what you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The
market is <i>not</i> driven by a technically superior kernel, or an OS
that avoids its crashes a few times a day. Users don't (mostly) care.
They just reboot and get on with it. They want apps. If the apps they
want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose. Windows has the apps. Linux
does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to nice areas (video
production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core now will
probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to see
Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the
apps are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This
is where the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> Where do you think the future <i>ought</i> to lie for
desktop Linux?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> There is none. The future for Linux for anything that isn't
a headless server in a back room tirelessly serving out data and
services all day long is on the device market, from PDA to phone to
watch.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> What's the least-tapped area of desktop development, if
there is one &gt;&nbsp;-- a place where there's room for real growth and
innovation?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Again - not much. The device space is where the interesting
stuff is at. :)</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> Some projects in Linux -- KDE and GNOME are among them --
have become truly huge, involving hundreds of people. You've worked on
very big projects and on smaller ones, where you have more control,
without the need for a consensus before a feature is added or a direction is 
chosen. Is there anything lost when a project grows to a size where 
scores of people are involved? Does the model of free software 
development that works so well when there are just a few developers 
scale well? Does it have advantages over the lone developer or small 
group of developers?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> When projects get too big people spend more time in
politics (talking on mailing lists and waiting for others) than actually
doing something useful. Generally, splitting something up, not autonomous
units, and have them work on their own and just end up working in unison
ends up more efficient, imho. This still means people have to agree how
they interface, but again, imho, the "benevolent dictator" method when
one or a very small number decide the important bits (the glue between
the parts) and then let the rest roll. I also don't see "the more the
better" as better. Too many cooks spoil the broth. Sometimes one or two really
good people will easily beat 10 or 20 average ones only working on something in
their spare time. I personally prefer the "crack troops" style. Get five
or six <i>really</i> good people and they can do a lot. Hundreds of
part-timers, imho, don't work as well.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> You've worked on your own, and in a highly praised
project or two, and you've also worked in a more formal setting with a
Linux company. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each as you've 
experienced them? Would you be likely to work for a Linux-based company
again? Would you be likely to start a Linux-based company, as some of
the GNOME people have done with Ximian?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Advantages: You can work on stuff full time and get
hardware, bandwidth, support - but more than anything - time, to do things.
Disadvantages: When your company and its projects differ from your personal
goals and projects, things grate. The job isn't just a job. You code insanely -
easily 40, 50, 60, 70+ hours a week. But it's not just a job - it's a life, so
you care very much, and when your company doesn't agree with what you care
about, things get bad.</font></p>
<p><font class="content">Would I work for a Linux-based company? Certainly. I don't think of having a
"job". I don't have "working hours". I am always thinking about the code
I'm working on, or working on it, when I get out of bed, at night before
I go to sleep, weekends, on planes. any time. And thinking about
designs, solutions etc., anywhere from walking down the street to being
at dinner or lunch. It's not a job - it's a lifestyle and working for a
Linux company melds in well.</font></p>
<p><font class="content">Would I start one? Certainly - <b><i>if</i></b> I could get the
venture capital - but who would fund such a thing these days... even if
I could pull some really smart motivated people together - I could, but
who would pay them whilst we busily develop a product to actually sell?
Bring the VC back as it used to be three years ago or so and I wouldn't
even blink before giving it a go.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> If memory serves, there was a time when you didn't think
the GPL was the best of all possible licenses.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Still don't.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> What kind of license do you think would be best for
spurring growth of Linux on the desktop while also addressing the 
needs and desires of developers themselves?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> I choose BSD with the advertising clause. Why? It lets
people steal the code. Yes. If someone is smart they can steal any code
they want, GPL, BSD, even commercial code. Dis-assembling to figure out
the smarts of a system isn't new. Any programmer half-smart can take any
GPL code and morph it into something so unrecognizable it would be
impossible to prove legally (beyond reasonable doubt) that they violated
copyright. I'm a realist. I know anyone could steal my code if it was
GPL - so why live in a fantasy? Accept the fact, let them steal it -
just ask them to be nice and tell you they did so you at least get the
satisfaction of knowing your code was of use to someone. That's my view on it.
:)</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> Enlightenment was initially the window management system
for GNOME, but now Sawfish is chiefly used. How did that come about? Was that a 
disappointment to you, or in retrospection do you see it as a good thing?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Actually incorrect. Enlightenment started long before GNOME
existed. It was a window manager that did more than just manage windows.
It was completely themable, handled your desktop background, pagers,
launcher bar, icons and menus and more. It merely was the first (and for
a while the only) window manager to fully support gnome applications.
That is all.</font></p>

<p><font class="content">I offered to mould e to be the GNOME wm, but at the time Miguel was convinced
you could do a desktop without a wm. I got quite bored of explaining this wasn't
possible, so by the time he realized he needed wm support I was merrily making e
do its own thing again regardless of GNOME and its goals. Eventually
GNOME got its own wm(s). Good for them. But e never was intended for
GNOME - was around before GNOME, and still does its own merry thing.</font></p>

<p><font class="content">Personally, I'm very happy not to have to debate standards for eons and just get
to go on and do interesting things and experiment with freedom. It was that
freedom with experimenting that brought you window managers that could do themes
and pixmaps in their borders, and shaped windows borders, pagers that showed
miniatures of your desktop and more... now everyone does them, but e did most of
them first and broke the ground. I plan on keeping on doing some
breaking :)</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> Speaking of Enlightenment -- where is it headed? What
paths is it following that other desktops aren't?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> It's a really nice way for me to test evas and push it to
do more :)</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> For years, Enlightenment has had the reputation of being 
unquestionably the most attractive desktop imaginable -- some say for 
any platform, Mac included -- but really difficult to configure. Is 
that reputation deserved? Do you think it ever was? Who is the user 
who would find enlightenment especially rewarding?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Difficult - yes. I agree. :) I always intended the really
cluey people to make configurations for the less cluey, and for them to wrap up all the complex
options into nice simple bundles, but that never happened, so now I'm moving to
doing that myself.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> As Linux has grown, so has the horsepower of the
equipment needed to do much useful with the newer stuff. Do you think
the idea that Linux is the desktop of choice for those who have older
equipment is now pretty much dead? What does it take to run
Enlightenment? How does this compare with the "big" desktop
projects?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Personally, since hardware is so dirt cheap I see no
difference between Windows and Linux. Enlightenment was never intended
for old systems - fvmw or twm do the job quite fine. It's intended to
make use of all that raw cpu and gfx power you have - since most of the
day it sits and does nothing (just check your cpu stats one day).
Computers spend more time waiting on users to catch up than anything
else really. :) E is there to poke and prod and do something new. KDE
and GNOME are there to appeal to the masses. :)</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> You've been working on ways of making direct desktop
calls to OpenGL. Given its level of development and relative complexity in 
configuration -- at least as it's shipped by Linux distributors -- how
do you write around what might be seen as a rickety aspect of the X
Window System? Are you presuming users who have gotten it set up 
and working well, or do you hope that distributions will have gotten 
it sorted out a little better by the time your desktop software is ready
for broad use?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> No no no. Thats not evas. Evas is a canvas - you don't draw
like "draw a line" "draw a box" draw this string" "paint this image".
It's object based. You <i>create</i> a line. You <i>create</i> an image.
You move and resize the objects, show and hide them, etc.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"> Evas handles all the logic there of how to redraw and what to redraw most
optimally. It <i>also</i> abstracts to the display system underneath;
<i>one</i> such display system is OpenGL - evas handles that as one of
its output systems. It can also just use your cpu or basic Xserver
calls,and more. OpenGL is simply a way of making the routines display
faster if your hardware is supported by OpenGL. Personally I avoid
OpenGL, as its still <i>waay</i> too flakey to trust, and instead
rely on my own software cpu rendering routines.</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>LaM:</b> Will e still play nicely with the new GNOME? Can it
readily be set up &gt;&nbsp;as the window manager in a GNOME 2 system?</font></p>

<p><font class="content"><b>R:</b> Simple answer: no :)</font></p>

now, most Linux GUI efforts have followed the traditional WIMP model,
and most efforts to develop Linux desktop applications have been
focused on simply recreating equivalents of existing software products.
As a result, mainstream desktop users have found few compelling reasons
to switch to Linux because it does not currently offer an experience
that is fundamentally any different from that of Windows or MacOS
(notwithstanding its lower price and superior reliability).<br>
<br>
Thanks to environments such as MacOS and Windows, the "Windows, Icons,
Menus, Pointing Device" (WIMP) user interface that we are all familiar
with has been phenomenally successful at bringing computing power into
the hands of a vast new set of users. WIMP is so entrenched that it is
hard to imagine this approach won't be used forever. Indeed, for many
users, there is no reason to use anything other than the traditional
user interfaces they are using today. But the fact remains that the
current method of managing information based on files, hierarchical
folders, and the desktop has not changed since 1984, and is becoming
obsolete in today's web- centric computing environment. WIMP, which was
first introduced in the 1960's, and then commercialized during the
1970's and 80's, was designed for a computing environment that is very
different than the one that exists today. Xerox PARC research, from
which much of the original Macintosh design was derived, was primarily
aimed at office automation to support small workgroups and a few
thousand documents. By contrast, the web is a shared information
environment for millions of users and potentially billions of
documents. Hardware capabilities have evolved dramatically since then
as well, offering continuously soaring CPU and graphics performance,
and storage capacity growth that is outpacing Moore's Law. It simply no
longer makes sense to run 1984 software on 2002 hardware.<br><br>Linux
offers a startling opportunity for driving new client platforms into
the mainstream, but as long as developers just try to make a "better
Windows than Windows" and stay focused on the old WIMP paradigm, there
will be no major upswing in the adoption of Linux on the client.
However, as truly next-generation user interfaces for Linux emerge,
they will enable the development of new kinds of applications that will
be difficult or impossible to match on the existing platforms. Such
"killer" applications (defined as applications that are so valuable

(Though his point is valid and very very important).
<br>

<br>
There are a number of different people using desktop computing for
various reasons I think that they fall into main 3 a main
catagories.....
<br>

<br>1) The home user (Rasters comments pertain mainly to these) and
these make up the largest part of the market. These people want access
to the mainstream apps, games etc. They want configureation to be
simple - If it is too hard they simply wont do it. There will always be
a small percentage of this market that will be more technically
orientated who will be able to make use of a linux desktop
<br>

<br>2) The Bussiness user. Needs a few apps to do bussiness. Needs
reliability ease of matainence and good value for money particularly
with regards to ongoing costs. I think you will see linux making
inroads into this market in the near future... I don't see it becoming
dominant but I see it playing an important role in desktops for many
businesses.
<br>

<br>3) Niche markets.... Audio and Video specialists.... 3d Art,
Medical imaging.. Those people have specialised needs in a desktop. I
think that linux has the power to really shine here. <br>
It is my hope that we will see linux companies to deal with these niche
markets.... Would you rather deal with a company that was making a
desktop machine for the masses or with you and your business in mind.
<br>

<br>Anyway I when I first got to the linux desktop the desktop
environments where just starting. Gnome was at 0.13, Enlightenment 14
was around the corner and KDE was not quite yet 1.0... I kind of
accepted that the apps would come start to really come out after the
desktop was stable and mature.... I hope i am right.
<br>

<br>
Can't wait to try E17.... Could never get the CVS version running (probs with imlib). Thanks R.

If the Linux desktop has no future what so ever, why in the ...hell
would anybody code in open source.???!!!... It would be a wast of time
even to code the simplest routine for a kernel called Linux be it in a
supercomputer or a wristwatch!!!... What for???... coding for a IBM,
HP, SUN or the like, including companys whit proprietary embeded
systems, that could easely pay for the work???. GNU and Linux have born
rebels for the common mortals for simple machines, that couldnt or
wouldnt pay the M$ tax...IBM, HP, SUN and the rest came after, and no
mater how good they appear, they dont give a shit about common mortals,
if no profit involved,... they are only taking advantage of brilliant
coders, whit egos bigger than them brains, and starving for
recognition... and these in them blindness of pride, dont see that
coding in open source, anything that would not be profitable for the
common mortals (server, desktop, whatever...), and for free(gratis),
will end up being an incredible stupid mistake!!!...
<br>

<br>
NO POSSIBLE DESKTOP!!!!!!
<br>

<br>
Whas a possible Linux desktop that started the nowadays Linux Server and Linux embeded, and if you dont agree, just imagine:
<br>

<br>
A WORLD WHIT ALL SERVER AND "TRANSPARENT TO THE USER SYSTEMS" RUNNING LINUX. AND ALL DESKTOP MACHINES RUNNING WINDOWS.
<br>

<br>
Now imagine that MS finds a better way to communicate intersystems than the TCP/IP method:
<br>

<br>DONT YOU AGREE THAT THE INSTANT AFTER MS WOULD MAKE THE WINDOWS
DESKTOP "TOTALY- MEAN TOTALY" INCOMPATIBLE WHIT LINUX NO MATER
WHAT??????????????????????????????????(I would) <br>

<br>
AND DONT YOU AGREE THAT THE WINDOWS DESKTOP WOULD EASILY WIN THAT WAR,
AND DRIVE TO EXTINCTION THE LINUX
SERVER?????????????????????????(anybody feel "FREE" to desagree).
<br>

<br> What Linux needs is a strong Desktop,...like air to bread. It
needs solid free standards,...it needs a unified FRAMEWORK instead of
the 3 diferents KDE, GNOME and GNUSTEP,... and it needs much less
"Rastermens". <br>

I've been hearing that the Linux desktop is dead for going on, for at
least, 4 years now. Still KDE and GNOME are coming on strong. More and
more hardware is supporting Linux. The various office suites are
getting better and better. And the installation of the major
distributions are getting to the point of brainless ease. Do we have to
endure another so called "VISIONARY" of the Linux movement declare the
Linux desktop to be dead? How many times is Rasterman going to flip
flop, like Red Hat, before we realize that the desktop for Linux is
evolution instead of revolution? Oh, so he works for a company that
does Linux embedded systems, and the future is going to be in embedded
devices? No personal bias here is there?</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>[ No Comments Allowed for Anonymous, please <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021216233956/http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=Your_Account">register</a>  ]<br><br><ul><li><font class="content" color="#0000ff"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021216233956/http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=comments&amp;op=showreply&amp;tid=262&amp;sid=141&amp;pid=261&amp;mode=&amp;order=&amp;thold=#262">Re: What an IDIOT!</a> by finwaite on Sunday, July 21 @ 12:03:58 EDT</font><br><ul><li><font class="content" color="#0000ff"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021216233956/http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=comments&amp;op=showreply&amp;tid=300&amp;sid=141&amp;pid=262&amp;mode=&amp;order=&amp;thold=#300">And I would, however...</a> by cweed on Tuesday, July 23 @ 23:19:01 EDT</font><br></li></ul></li></ul><a name="265"></a><table width="99%" border="0"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td width="500"><b>I need an Old Priest and a Young Priest!

respect Mr. Haitzler's opinion about the non-future of Linux on the
desktop. But, as most programmers do(or rather don't), he doesn't see
the big picture. His focus is 10^-6.
<br>

<br> Linux will have to be on the desktop if it is to hold onto the
server space. There is no question about it. Novell's hospital bound
ulcer ridden CEO is proof of how only price/performance isn't what
makes a server. <br>

<br>
Microsoft will kill us if we give them the desktop. I don't think
anyone reading this column doubts that. Linux will not be able to
maintain or expand it's server foothold when LongHorn only speaks to MS
TCP/IP-CIFSv.X. There is no option here folks. .NET is creeping onto
clients as we speak. <br>

<br>
The Desktop for linux does have to mature, and it seems, without
Enlightenment. But it will mature and at a price point that MS cannot
compete with. It's just a matter of time and pressure. Too bad
Enlightenment will miss the ride. I wish Rasterman the best, but his
opinion on this particular day is short-sighted. <br>
