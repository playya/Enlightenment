Inkscape can save the SVG as "GIMP XCF mantaining layers", keep the guides and
ignore the grids.

It might take a while doing seemingly nothing and throw the error
"_,f,err = os.popen3(command,'r')" but it works anyway unless additional errors
are displayed.

Once in gimp you can use the guides to cut the images and hide layers for the
logos' alpha backgrounds (and other alpha backgrounds in the future).

Also, before commiting the SVG file use "delete defs" and save it again. This
deletes unused gradients and other xml rubbish reducing the size (often by a
lot).
