<h1>Contributing</h1>

<p>If you're looking to help out on the project you're in the right place.
We are always looking for people to work on code, do translations, write
documentation, help new users, answer forum questions or verify bugs. If
this kind of thing peaks your interest keep reading.</p>

<p>All of the Enlightenment development happens out of the SVN repository.
You can browse the repository through the
<a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk">Trac</a> interface.
You can work off of the snapshots but you'll always be behind the current
set of patches and fixes that are in SVN. Any bugs being report should be
done against the latest SVN revisions.</p>

<p>Please see <a href=http://svn.enlightenment.org>svn.enlightenment.org</a>
for more information on how to use SVN.</p>

<p>For more information about the different EFL libraries please consult the
<a href="http://wiki.enlightenment.org">wiki</a> and
<a href="http://docs.enlightenment.org">documentation</a>. Any bugs
identified, or features desired, can be entered into the
<a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e">Tracker</a>.</p>
