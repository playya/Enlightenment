<h3>An overview of the Enlightenment Fountation Libraries (EFL)</h3>

<span class="contentmain">
<p>
The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) are a collection of libraries that make up the foundation 
of the DR17 window manager.  While their original intent was solely to support the window manager, the libraries
quickly took on a life of their own, which is a contributing factor to the delays of the window manager itself.
These libraries are so powerful, flexable, and easy to use that they present a strong platform on which to
develop nearly any graphical application you could think of.
</p>

<p>
The EFL begins with Imlib2, a general image manipulation and rendering
library, and Evas, our canvas library.
Because Evas is built on several diffrent selectable engines (Linux
FrameBuffer, DirectFB, X11, OpenGL, QTopia, etc)
the platform is extremely portable, which translates thru to all of the
libraries built on top of it.
Ecore is a modular convience library that in its base provides timers,
callback functionality, and loop management for
event handling. Ecore's various modules can simplify the setup of an
X11 drawable for general use (Ecore_X11), an X11 drawable for
use with Evas (Ecore_Evas), manage IPC (Ecore_IPC), manage BSD Sockets
(Ecore_Con), management of the FrameBuffer (Ecore_FB), and more.
Because Ecore can simplify so many tasks that are used in conjuction
with Evas it has lived up to its name as the core componant of nearly
any EFL application.
</p>

<p>Edje provides a revolutionary method of absstacting every aspect of
your interface from the application itself. By passing signals
between the interface and the application all communication is done in
an interface neutral way. No longer are &quot;themes&quot; simple changes
of pixmaps over a fixed area. Using Embryo we can provide scripting
ability to the interface componant itself to harness even more power
and flexability.
</p>

<p>EWL brings all the libs into focus, providing a complete end-to-end
widget library for fast and easy development of complex graphical
applications.
</p>

<p>
Below is a diagram of how the various componants of the EFL fit together.  Because
of complexity of the libraries and the fact that so many libraries can be used
independant of other EFL libraries we have a diagram alittle more complex than
your standard block diagram.
