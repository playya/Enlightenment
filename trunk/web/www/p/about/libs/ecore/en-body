<p>What is Ecore? It is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction
layer that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops,
timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a separate
library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job
easy for applications.
</p>

<p>
Ecore is completely modular.  At its base is the event handlers and timers, and initialization
and shutdown functions.  The abstraction modules for Ecore include:</p>

<ul><li>Ecore X 
</li><li>Ecore FB
</li><li>Ecore EVAS
</li><li>Ecore TXT 
</li><li>Ecore Job
</li><li>Ecore IPC
</li><li>Ecore Con
</li><li>Ecore Config
</li></ul>


<p>
Ecore's most popular use is to answer the plee &quot;Just give me a damned canvas!&quot;
Here is an example of Ecore's EVAS module being used to simplify all
the setup needed to create an X11 EVAS:

</p>

<div class="fragment">
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;Ecore_Evas.h&gt;
#define WIDTH 200
#define HEIGHT 200

Ecore_Evas  *ee;
Evas        *evas;
Evas_Object *base_rect;

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  ecore_init();
  ee = ecore_evas_software_x11_new(NULL, 0,  0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  ecore_evas_title_set(ee, &quot;Ecore Template&quot;);
  ecore_evas_borderless_set(ee, 0);
  ecore_evas_show(ee);
  evas = ecore_evas_get(ee);

  evas_font_path_append(evas, &quot;data/&quot;);
  base_rect = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);
  evas_object_resize(base_rect, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  evas_object_color_set(base_rect, 244, 243, 242, 255);
  evas_object_show(base_rect);

  /* More code here... */

  ecore_main_loop_begin();
  return 0;
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ecore is so modular and powerful that it can be extremely useful even in non-graphics
programing by itself.  As an example, several web servers have been written that
were based solely on Ecore and the Ecore_Con module that abstracts socket communication.
For more information on Ecore and its modules, please refer the the documentation.
