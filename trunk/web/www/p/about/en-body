    <h1>About Enlightenment</h1>
    <p>We are dedicated to providing advanced graphical libraries, tools, and environments. 
    Currently, the project is made up of three different components:
    Enlightenment DR16, Enlightenment DR17, and the Enlightenment Foundation
    Libraries.  While we are best known for the Enlightenment Window Manager itself there is a 
    long history of providing advanced libraries and tools to support the window manager and 
    other applications, such as Imlib, Imlib2, and FNLib which extend far beyond the window 
    manager itself in scope.  Today, in development toward the DR17 Desktop Shell we have 
    created an entirely new set of libraries and tools that provide more power and 
    flexibility than any other group of graphical libraries available, The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.

    <h2>Enlightenment DR16</h2>
    <p>DR16 of the Enlightenment window manager, also known as e16, was released in 2000.
    While rumors of its death still circulate, version 1.0.1 was released on September 10th, 2009.  DR16 has been the choice of power 
    users and artists due to its low overhead, highly graphical, widely theme-able, extremely 
    configurable, yet unobtrusive interface. Nearly all functions of the window manager can be 
    handled without mouse input, including application launching via 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">e16keyedit</a>. It also remains 
    highly portable, with ports avalible for Linux, FreeBSD, IRIX, Solaris X86 and Sparc, HP-UX, 
    AIX, OS/2, and more.</p>

    <h2>Enlightenment DR17</h2>
    <p>DR17 of the Enlightenment window manager represents an evolution into the next generation of 
    desktop environments: the desktop shell. DR17 will provide integration between files and your 
    environment in a seamless manner while encompassing a graphically rich and flexible architecture. 
    It will not compete with GNOME or KDE, but be a completely new way of visualizing your desktop, 
    based around the EFL which was built from the ground up for this task.</p>

    <p> Still in heavy development, several applications that will be part of the DR17 release and 
    examples of what is possible are already available in SVN, such as Entice, Entrance, and Evidence.</p>

    <h2>Enlightenment Foundation Libraries</h2>
    <p>In developing DR17 it was made clear that we needed an entirely new set of libraries and tools. 
    Raster had a bold vision of what was possible and where he wanted the next release to go, starting 
    with Imlib2 and EVAS, and eventually growing into new libraries largely based on, or around, EVAS. 
    It became clear that the usefulness of these libraries and tools went far beyond the DR17 release 
    itself, just as Imlib did in DR16. Thus the collective library back-end of DR17 was given the 
    independent title: the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, or EFL for short. </p>          
   
    <p>The EFL contains solutions for almost any graphical interface task, far beyond just rendering 
    images. EVAS provides a highly optimized canvas library. Ecore provides a simple and modular 
    abstraction interface and advanced event management including timers. EDB provides a compact 
    database format for intuitive and easy configuration management, including the storing of binaries. 
    EET provides an integrated and flexible container that ends the traditions of providing 
    themes in tarballs. Edje provides a revolutionary library and tool set for <i>completely</i> 
    abstracting application interfaces from their code, including a complex and flexible method of 
    designing interfaces. EWL provides a complete widget library built on all the other 
    components of the EFL.</p>
