<a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> developer Jamie
Bennett announced in his blog post <a
href="http://www.linuxuk.org/2010/02/the-new-ui-for-arm-based-ubuntu-devices/">The
New UI for ARM Based Ubuntu Devices</a> how Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries (EFL) enabled rich graphical user interfaces even on
non-3D-accelerated ARM devices.

<p>
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries were conceived and developed with
performance in mind. Started in 2000, the current incarnation was
designed based on previous experience with Imlib and Imlib2, libraries
known to be quite fast. Over the past 10 years, the API changed a lot to
be easier to use, but the performance impact of each and every change was
carefully considered and benchmarked using the <a
href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Expedite">Expedite</a> tool.
</p>
<p>
The most performance-critical part of EFL is definitely <a
href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Evas">Evas</a>, the canvas
(drawing) library. Fast in both software- and hardware-accelerated environments,
it always shipped with lots of engines such as buffer, X11 (Xlib/Xcb)
and XRender, but it recently gained more interesting engines due to companies
that contributed back their work:
<ul>
<li>16 bit-per-pixel-optimized engine, contributed by <a href="http://www.indt.org.br">INdT</a>.</li>
<li>SDL, contributed by <a href="http://free.fr">Free.fr</a>.</li>
<li>DirectFB, contributed by <a href="http://profusion.mobi">ProFUSION</a>.</li>
<li>OpenGL-ES, contributed by <a href="http://samsung.com">Samsung</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
However, Evas is not the only optimized piece of EFL. <a
href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Eet">Eet</a>, used for
binary, read-efficient configuration and resources file, boosted
Canonical's Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR) startup time. The initial
version using GConf was quite slow to provide information, so these
were cached with Eet for immediate access to background images,
display modes, and font configuration.
</p>
<p>
Aside from being used for configuration files, Eet is also the base of
<a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Edje">Edje</a>, the
theme system used by UNR, Enlightenment DR17, Elementary,
<a href="http://openbossa.indt.org/canola">Canola2</a> and
others. Edje manages a state machine of Evas objects' states, described in a
JSON/C-like language, later compiled into an access- and space-efficient
binary format. Its power and flexibility continually amaze its users,
as said by Jamie in his post:
<blockquote>
Another of the great things about this launcher, as opposed to the 3D
launcher shipped with Karmic, is that it's extremely theme-able.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, the new kid on the block, <a
href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Elementary">Elementary</a>,
boosted development time with its canned ready-to-use widgets. Like
all the previously-presented libraries, Elementary is very fast
and customizable. It is quite unnoticeable in UNR, but it is the base
of lists and some error dialogs.
</p>
<p>
The Enlightenment team is proud its products are being used more and more
on embedded systems, be they e-book readers, phones, or TV's&#59; x86,
ARM, or MIPS&#59; accelerated or non-accelerated hardware.
