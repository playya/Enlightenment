<p>Work is continuing on DR17 and the supporting EFL. CVS has been a bit slow
for the last few weeks due to other responsiblities of the developers but
things are starting to pick back up again.</p>

<!-- cut -->

<p>The TODO list for DR17 is getting slimmed down. A new theme is in the works.
With two main items, and a pile of small ones and bugs, hopefully we'll find
a tunnel to look for the light at the end of.</p>

<p>We've done a bit of a re-vamp of the website as well. We hope the new layout
is easier to use and makes it simpler to find things. If something
still seems confusing, out of place, missed or just plain wrong send me an
email. I'm interested in any feedback. Yes, I now we need some icons and
things. We're in the process of planning what will fit on the site.</p>

<p>There is a new <a href="http://bugs.enlightenment.org">bugzilla</a>
product available for the website. Feel free to report bugs, suggestings in
there.</p>
