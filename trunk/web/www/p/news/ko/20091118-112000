<p>
We are working with a top-5 electronics producer (one of the largest in the
world, who produces millions of mobile phones, televisions, sound systems
and more per year) to bring Enlightenment and especially it's deep technology
to their products. In fact not just working with this manufacturer, but they
are actively sponsoring development on Enlightenment and EFL to ensure it does
what is needed for their products (beyond what it already does).

What does this mean for you as users and developers? It means that you are
likely to see top-quality electronic devices running the same things you use
on your desktop. This means as a developer the same libraries and API's will
be there, ready to use, out of the box. You can even start your development
now in anticipation. Use Elementary, Evas, Edje, Ecore, Eet, Eina, and so on
and design for a small screen with a "finger" and minimal keyboard (by small
screen i mean in the range of 240x320, 320x480 and so on up to 480x800 for
portrait, and similar for landscape (320x240, 480x320, 800x480).

Do it now so you have code that already works. you can develop on the desktop
no problems and it ports with a simple "make" to the devices in question.

That's about all the information we have for now. Expect something in the
future with more details, such as what products and roughly when.
