New CVS Server

We have a new CVS server! Both developer and anonymous CVS servers have changed now.
The new anonymous server can be checked out from using:

<pre>    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.enlightenment.org:/var/cvs/e checkout e17</pre>

And the developer one:

<pre>    cvs -z3 -d USERNAME@cvs.enlightenment.org:/cvs/e checkout e17</pre>

You know the rest. Have fun!
