<p>
A new project tracker for milestones, TODO lists and even bugs (for those that
may hate bugzilla) is now up.
<a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e">trac.enlightenment.org/e</a> is now
available for putting up TODO lists and public milestones so peopl can see what
we are doing and how its progressing.

<p>
This is in <b>ADDITION</b> to
<a href="http://bugs.enlightenment.org">bugs.enlightenment.org</a>, but isn't
intended to compete. Some people like bugzilla, and it is indeed very
powerful, but it doesn't work well for documenting project goals, timelines
and "TODO" lists. So <a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e">trac</a> is now
up too to do this. We hope to have more visibility of what we are doing, what
is to be done, and how you then can help.
