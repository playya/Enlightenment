The code monkeys are hard at work

<p>Contrary to how it may seem from the number of news updates on enlightenment.org, we are hard at work.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of work done on e17 to add new features, fixup numerous bugs and streamline the different features of the system. There are quite a number of new features available in e17. A quick list, being nowhere near exhaustive:</p>
<ul>
 <li>We moved to .desktop files</li>
 <li>Lots of work on the file dialog</li>
 <li>Gradient backgrounds</li>
 <li>New icons</li>
 <li>We've overhaul'd the namespace of the theme (this is one more for themers then anything)</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside e17 there's also been a lot of work done on the surrounding library universe.
I'm not going to go into it all here, checkout the commits list and the mailing lists if you're really interested.</p>

<p>So, in summary, we aren't dead. We just suck at updating the website (which will hopefully be getting better soon).</p>
