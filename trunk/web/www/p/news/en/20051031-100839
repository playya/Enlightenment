Thanks to our freinds at http://www.thinktux.net off in the Alps in Switzerland, we have a new Anonymous CVS Mirror.
This will NOT ALLOW WRITES and it is not ALWAYS up to date with development CVS as it syncs every 30 minutes from development
CVS, BUT it is at most 30 minutes behind, and apparently has a lot of bandwidth.

<p>And you can check out a tree for e17 with this command:</p>

<pre>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@thinktux.net/root co e17</pre>

<p>So everyone having problems getting into sf.net anonymous CVS, this is another option. Thanks to om1n[A]e and null!</p>
