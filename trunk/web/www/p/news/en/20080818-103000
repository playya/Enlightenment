Over the weekend, I have imported our entire CVS history into SVN. At
<a href=http://svn.enlightenment.org>svn.enlightenment.org</a> you can find
out how to check out the new respository or use the tracker to browse it and
all the changes.

The move to SVN comes after a decade or so of using CVS. We are re-organising
the content a bit and now using Trac as a way of tracking code changes in
public, feature requests and bug reporting.
