<p>
We're excited to announce the third beta release of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. The focus of this release was portability and build issues. We should thank all the people that helped us by packaging all this libraries on so many different systems. We should run better now, especially on OpenBSD and Mac OS X systems. It's really the right time to help us package it for more targets and rock on all of them!
</p>

<p>
The API and ABI of all this beta3 libraries are considered stable, but please test your apps with them and report back any issues you may encouter. Thanks to the last round of beta, a small numbers of bugs have been identified. Once they are fixed we will jump into the release candidates cycle.
</p>

<p>
As the end of this beta cycle get closer, we still need a lot of help to write documentation, tutorials and examples. If you have time to contribute, it's a good area to help today! As you may have noticed, or not, the situation is already improving. If you give a look to our <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=docs">daily updated documentation</a> or to our <a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/">wiki</a>, you will see some progress.
</p>

<p>
Testing is pretty easy, if you're using the EFL from our Subversion repository you can test with revision 55246, but to ensure a smooth release later on, please consider testing with the tarballs provided <a href="http://download.enlightenment.org/releases/">here</a>.
