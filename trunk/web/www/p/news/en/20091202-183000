</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecating eet_data_descriptor*_new</li>

<li>Add eina helper</li>
<li>Cleanup Eet_Data_Descriptor code</li>
<li>Fix eet data encode to encode empty structs etc. so save saves something as opposed to nothing</li>
<li>Fix documentation of eet_data_write() and eet_write() for return value to return # of bytes written, not 1 or 0</li>
<li>Fix build with suncc (missing alloca() declaration in eet_cipher.c)</li>
<li>Use new Eina_Log infrastructure to report error</li>
<li>Remove apparently useless eet_freeleak_* from eet_data</li>

<li>Initialize eina first in eet_init()</li>
<li>Allow generation of one single file with all source code in it. See configure help to enable it (--enable-amalgamation)</li>
<li>Add check on libgcrypt library in configure. Needed when GNUtls support is enabled</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The snapshot release of Eina, Evas, Ecore, Embryo, Edje, E_Dbus, Efreet,
Enlightenment and Elementary includes lots of improvements and fixes. Too many
to put here, but these are not considered stable yet, and thus we don't track
changelogs. They do impose soname changes and module versioning now to make
packaging cleaner alongside SVN source installs. Please download, try and test
these.
