The Enlightenment.Org Domain

You may have noticed that in November enlightenment.org seemingly disappeared. The site was in fact up the whole time,
it was the domain that we lost... or nearly lost. Long story short, the domain expired and we were unable to register
it without waiting out the grace period and hoping we nabbed it in time. Hope was slim and there was a good chance we'd
loose our domain for good. Thankfully we were saved by the good people at EasyDNS! They noticed that the domain had expired
and wasn't being renewed and figured it had to be a mistake, and indeed it was. They have given us the domain and even have
provided the domain and hosting to us at no cost! Not only is our domain secure but we no longer have to pay out of pocket
for it. So a big thanks goes to the fine people at EasyDNS for saving the day! More site updates will be coming soon.
Stay tuned.
