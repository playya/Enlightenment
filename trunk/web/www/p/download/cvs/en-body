E17 is developed using CVS as a source code repository system. We even use CVS
for this website. Anonymous checkouts of any CVS module can be done with the
following command:
<pre>
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.enlightenment.org:/var/cvs/e co <b>MODULE</b>
</pre>
</p><p>
There are several modules in CVS - each for different purposes. Below is a
description of them and their uses:

If you become a developer (get DEV CVS access) Then you will need to use a
different CVS server. You need to ask permission from an existing developer
to gain DEV CVS access. To do this you will need to first know what your
USERNAME will be, have it added by an existing developer and you will need to
provide your SSH public key for this to happen, then the below will get you
started:
</p><p>
<pre>
export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 -d <b>USERNAME</b>@cvs.enlightenment.org:/cvs/e co <b>MODULE</b>
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have the tree you can use the tree as normal and commit, add, remove
etc. files from CVS. Note that we have a cvs-commits mailing list where all
CVS commits go to - all developers should subscribe to this list and follow
it. This is how we know what you do, when and where.
