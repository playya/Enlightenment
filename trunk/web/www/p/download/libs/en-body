Enlightenment started life as just a window manager for X11, but has grown
to be much larger and now is split up into several libraries, other utilities
and applications as well as Enlightenment itself. The libraries are stand-alone
and useful for many things other than Enlightenment. They let anyone make use
of the same code, files and back-end that Enlightenment does for its graphics
and other functions.
