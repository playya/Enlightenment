Enlightenment DR17 (or E17 for short) is being actively developed for the last three years.</p><p>
We are using CVS for our repository, so one of the ways to get E is to
download it directly from the repository, as it is explaned <a
href='http://web.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=download/cvs&l=en'>here</a>.
Although we are trying to keep the code there stable and usable, there is
still a chance to get it at a bad moment when it is broken. So, for the
users who would prefer more stable (but older) E, there are development snapshots.</p><p> 
Development snapshots are packages (archives) with E17 and it's core
libraries inside. They are being created regularly, usually when some new
feature is made and, of course when everything is "stable". Please keep in
mind that these are not official releases and E is still considered
pre-alpha code. This means that it may still have bugs and some of the features are not implemented yet. The snapshots are currently hosted <a href='http://enlightenment.freedesktop.org/'>here</a>.</p><p>
Another (and maybe the most preferable by users) way to have E on your
computer is to use packages made for your operating system or Linux distribution.
There are unofficial packages for most distributions, including Debian,
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=97199&highlight=E17+cvs">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://sps.nus.edu.sg/~didierbe">Fedora</a>, <a
href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/E17">ArchLinux</a>, <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_emerge_e17">Gentoo</a>, and so on. There are ports for E17 and EFL in FreeBSD's port collection. And again, there is no guarantee that those packages will work. If you experience any problems with E using the packages, please first refer to the packager(s), not to the E17 team.

FIXME: should the scripts for getting/installing E go here on in the CVS page?
