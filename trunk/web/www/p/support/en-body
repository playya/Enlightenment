<h1>Support</h1>

<p>There is a great community of helpful developers and users surrounding
the Enlightenment project. The following is a list of ways to get in contact
with this community.</p>

<p>We have been working on documenting the many portions of DR16, DR17 and
the EFL. Along with this system documentation we've been working on a few
books to help people get staring. All of this documentation is available at <a
href="http://docs.enlightenment.org">docs.enlightenment.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you're questions aren't answered in the standard documentation there
is a <a href="http://wiki.enlightenment.org">wiki</a> available to aid in
the support process. Along with the wiki is a 
<a href="http://forum.enlightenment.org">forum</a> to allow you to ask
your questions.</p>

<p>For those of you that aren't fans of all this web technology there are
also the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2">mailing lists</a>
and people hanging out in #e on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<p>If you've found a bug in something you can report it to the <a
href="http://bugs.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment Bugzilla</a>.</p>
