    <h3>What is Enlightenment?</h3>
    <p>
     Enlightenment is not just a window manager for
     <?php a("about", "Linux/X11 and others");?>, but also a
     <?php a("about", "whole suite of libraries");?> to help you create
     beautiful user interfaces with much less work than doing it the old
     fashioned way and fighting with traditional toolkits, not to mention a
     traditional window manager. It covers uses from
     <?php a("about", "small mobile devices like phones");?> all the way to
     powerful multi-core desktops (which are the primary development
     environment).

    <h3>Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)</h3>
    <p>
     These provide both a semi-traditional toolkit set in Elementary as well
     as the object canvas (Evas) and powerful abstracted objects (Edje) that
     you can combine, mix and match, even layer on top of each other with
     alpha channels and events in-tact. It has 3D transformations for all
     objects <?php a("about", "and more");?>.
    </p>

    <p>
     A simple overview of the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) stack
     is here. <?php a("about", "There is more to this");?>, but this gives
     a quick overview of where it fits in.
