    <h3>What is Enlightenment?</h3>
    <p>
     Enlightenment is not just a window manager for Linux/X11, but also a
     whole suite of libraries to help you create beautiful user interfaces
     with much less work than doing it the old fashioned way and fighting
     with traditional toolkits. Not to mention a traditional window manager.
     It covers uses from small mobile devices like phones all the way to
     powerful multi-core desktops.

    <p>
     It provides both a traditional toolkit set in Elementary as well as
     the object canvas (Evas) and powerful abstracted objects (Edje) that
     you can combine, mix and match, even layer on top of each other with
     alpha channels and events in-tact. It has 3D transformations of all
     objects and more.

     A simple overview of the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) stack
     is here. <?php a("about", "There is more to this");?>, but this gives
     a quick overview of where it fits in.
