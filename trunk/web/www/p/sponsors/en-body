<h3>Why donate?</h3>
<p>
In order to provide better services to our users, the Enlightenment 
	team would like to ask that the Enlightenment user community pull 
    together and help us raise funds for a new server. We are therefore
    requesting donations so that we may purchase our own dedicated server.
    If you would like to contribute to the Enlightenment project, but can't
    code, this is a great way to help out.
    <br/><br/>
    We would like to thank our current hosting provider, 
    <a href="http://www.caosity.org" target="_blank">the cAos Foundation</a>

    , who have generously donated access to their CVS
    services.
    <br/><br/>
	Long-time Enlightenment users are probably well aware of some of the 
	service issues we've experienced in recent years. The CVS services improved
	considerably with the move to our current provider, but the web site has 
	remained with SourceForge.  The restrictive permissions have prevented us 
	from providing many of the services to our users that we feel are 
	necessary. Services such as integrating CVS content with the website, bug 
	tracking, wiki access, and reasonable CMS services are simply too 
	difficult to provide with the access levels available on SourceForge. In 
	addition, external CMS access to SourceForge has proven to be unreliable 
	and very slow. As a result, the website has gone relatively unmaintained 
	for months, much of the content has moved to edevelop.org and get-e.org, 
	and hosted copies of API documentation have not been updated to reflect 
	significant changes which are documented in CVS. These issues hurt the 
	projects image, discourage new users, and frustrate existing users. We 
	feel a dedicated server is the best way to address these issues with the 
	level of quality expected from this project.
	<br/><br/>
    As a last note, we would like to extend our thanks to the people who
    have already donated the current funds of $1600 to the Enlightenment 
	project.  Your charity has not been forgotten, and your donations will be 
	applied towards the server fund.
