<h3>Why donate?</h3>
<p>
In order to provide better services to our users, the Enlightenment 
	team would like to ask that the Enlightenment user community 
pull 
    together and help us raise funds for a new server. We are therefore
    requesting donations so that we may purchase our own dedicated 
server.
    If you would like to contribute to the Enlightenment project, but 
can't
    code, this is a great way to help out.
    <br/><br/>
    We would like to thank our current hosting provider, 
    <a href="http://www.caosity.org" target="_blank">the cAos 
Foundation</a>

    , who have generously donated access to their CVS
    services.
    <br/><br/>
	Long-time Enlightenment users are probably well aware of some of 
the 
	service issues we've experienced in recent years. The CVS 
services improved
	considerably with the move to our current provider, but the web 
site has 
	remained with SourceForge.  The restrictive permissions have 
prevented us 
	from providing many of the services to our users that we feel 
are 
	necessary. Services such as integrating CVS content with the 
website, bug 
	tracking, wiki access, and reasonable CMS services are simply 
too 
	difficult to provide with the access levels available on 
SourceForge. In 
	addition, external CMS access to SourceForge has proven to be 
unreliable 
	and very slow. As a result, the website has gone relatively 
unmaintained 
	for months, much of the content has moved to edevelop.org and 
get-e.org, 
	and hosted copies of API documentation have not been updated to 
reflect 
	significant changes which are documented in CVS. These issues 
hurt the 
	projects image, discourage new users, and frustrate existing 
users. We 
	feel a dedicated server is the best way to address these issues 
with the 
	level of quality expected from this project.
	<br/><br/>
    As a last note, we would like to extend our thanks to the people who
    have already donated the current funds of $1600 to the Enlightenment 
	project.  Your charity has not been forgotten, and your 
donations will be 
	applied towards the server fund.

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
The Enlightenment would like to thank the following groups for their 
support of the project. Without their help we would not be where we are 
at today.
<h3>The community of users</h3>
<p>The users are a large part of the project without them there would 
not be much of a point to development. 
They are involved in the testing and development of Enlightenment and 
provide donations for things such as our new servers.
