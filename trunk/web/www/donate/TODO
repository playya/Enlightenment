o Move existing info to the sponsers page 
o Make the "why donate?" a bit more general now that we have the 
server... It might be nice to still put a mention about the server 
donation drive being successful and that we now reside on those servers.
o Ditch the meter all together
o Order the donors by date NOT by donation amount
o Write the information to a plain file instead of a mysql db
