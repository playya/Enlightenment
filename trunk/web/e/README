How E's Web Works
-----------------

This website uses an old scheme that we continue to use.
The web/e directory serves as the web root for enlightenment.org.
In this directory is found the following:

index.php	A redirect PHP script to pages/news.html
s/		A script directory for building the site
config/		A directory containing various web elements
		including page headers, footers and nav bars
data/		A directory containing the unparsed HTML pages.
		These are the files you want to edit!
pages/		A directory containing the parsed and output	
		HTML that will be seen by the world.
pages/img/	A directory containing images to be used by the HTML.


To update, for instance, the news, edit data/news.html.  Follow the
current format used and save that file. Then, in this directory (web/e)
run the build script "s/make", this will rebuild all the pages from
the data/ HTML directory.  This actually done by the parse program included
in the s/ direcotry, but shadowed from the user via the make script.

Always udpate cvs BEFORE you cvs commit, otherwise a commit will end up recommiting
every page, instead of just the ones you edited.  If you do things
properly, you should always be commiting at least 2 HTML files.
