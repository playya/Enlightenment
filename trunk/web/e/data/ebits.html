<p>Theme-ing has come a long way.  At one point in time (and in some cases still) themeablility was mearly the ability to change th
e default colors of the interface.  Later came the idea of replacing default objects with new modified ones.  But Enlightenment has
 always been on the front lines, defining with each update what it is to theme.  Through this journey its come to be that the theme
 is an integral part of the windowing enviroment, and is becoming more and more complex all the time.  A common method of modern th
eming is to provide a pool of images which are then "bound" together in a configuration to define size, padding, location, state an
d so on.  However this has become increasingly complex to manage, not to mention that theme-ing is no longer just something for "ey
e candy", but integral to the feel of your application.  The solution was <a href="ebits.html">Ebits</a>, which allows us a method 
to bind every kind of information possible for a theme into singular file.  This information includes size, position, context, stat
e, cursors, fonts, and a whole lot more.  These files are created with <a href="etcher.html">Etcher</a>.</p

<p>On of the reasons Ebits is so functional is due to its input file format, bit db's.  Ebit files are actually <a href="edb.html">Edb's</a> which can contain both binary and ascii data.  Each Ebits file (named <i>file</i>.bits.db) contains all the images and configuration data for that bit.  This removes the need for the specialized tarballs of old, and add alot of flexablility that wouldn't exsists with it being built on <a href="edb.html">Edb</a>.

<p>Ebits developers include: The Rasterman, Carlos Puchol, and Mark Bainter.  Their contact details can be found on the 
<a href="team.html">team page</a>.</p>
