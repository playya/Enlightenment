Embryo implements a C like scripting language used in various parts of the Enlightenment project, namely <a href="edje.html">Edje</a>.
Embryo's scripting language is based on <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/">CompuPhase's</a> <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/small.htm">Small</a>
language that was introduced in <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=898/ddj9910f/">Dr Dobb's Journal in 1999</a>.  
Embryo allows scripting capabilities in places that otherwise wouldn't support basic programming structures such as in Edje EDCs.
</p>

<p>
Documenation on the Small language itself can be found in several PDF booklets found <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/small.htm">on the
official small page</a>.
