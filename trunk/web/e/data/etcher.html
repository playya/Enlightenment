<p class="contenttitle">Etcher</p>
<p>Etcher is a graphical editing tool for creating and
  manipulating <a href="ebits.html">Ebits</a> GUI elements.
  Just as an example, the window borders currently used in
  E17 were created with Etcher.</p>

<p><img src="img/etcher.png" alt="Etcher screenshot"></p>

<p>Using Etcher you can arrange various images, and define
   their behavior when the GUI element is resized.
   Etcher is <b>not</b> a drawing program. Etcher-made
   GUI elements can be used by any application that uses the
   Ebits library.</p>

<p>Etcher's developers are The Rasterman, Christian "cK" Kreibich and most recently Christopher "smugg" Rosendahl.  Their contact details can be found on the 
<a href="team.html">team page</a>.</p>
