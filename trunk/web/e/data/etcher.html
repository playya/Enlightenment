<p>Theme-ing has come a long way.  At one point in time (and in some cases still) themeablility was mearly the ability to change the default colors of the interface.  Later came the idea of replacing default objects with new modified ones.  But Enlightenment has always been on the front lines, defining with each update what it is to theme.  Through this journey its come to be that the theme is an integral part of the windowing enviroment, and is becoming more and more complex all the time.  A common method of modern theming is to provide a pool of images which are then "bound" together in a configuration to define size, padding, location, state and so on.  However this has become increasingly complex to manage, not to mention that theme-ing is no longer just something for "eye candy", but integral to the feel of your application.  The solution was <a href="ebits.html">Ebits</a>, which allows us a method to bind every kind of information possible for a theme into singular file.  This information includes size, position, context, state, cursors, fonts, and a whole lot more.  These files are created with <a href="etcher.html">Etcher</a>.</p>

<p>Using Etcher we can sew various images together, and then define how all these images fit together.  Please understand that Etcher is <b>not</b> a drawing program.  To begin in Etcher you should create a number of graphics in your favorite graphics application, such as <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a>.  To create a window theme (or <b>bit</b>) we should, in our graphics app, create images to be used for the title bar, the iconize button, the close button, and various window borders.  Then we can open Etcher and import these images.  By placing the images around the workspace you can define how the images should fit together, how they should move together, and how they should react.  We can go so far as to define clicked states, selected states, unselected states, and more.  Once you have the bit set up the way you think you'd like it you can save it to a <b>bit.db</b> file.  These bit.db files can be used by any application that uses the Ebits library.</p>

<p>With Ebits and Etcher, the possibilities for a unique look and feel for your application are limited to your imagination, not a color spectrum.</p>

<p>Etcher's primary developers are The Rasterman and Christian "cK" Kreibich.  Their contact details can be found on the
