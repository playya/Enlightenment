<p>
Welcome to The Enlightenment Project.
</p>

<p>
We are dedicated to providing
advanced graphical libraries, tools, and environments.  Currently,
the project is made up of three different components: Enlightenment
DR16, The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, and Enlightenment DR17.
While  we are best known for the Enlightenment Window Manager itself
there is a long history of providing advanced libraries and tools 
to support the window manager and other applications, such as Imlib,
FNLib, and Imlib2, which extend far beyond the window manager itself
in scope.  Today, in development toward the DR17 <a href="faq.html">Desktop Shell</a>
we have created an entirely new set of libraries and tools that 
provide more power and flexibility than any other group of
graphical libraries available, which we refer to collectively as
The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.

<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment DR16</p>

<p>
The Enlightenment DR16 window manager was released in 2000, along with its 
dependencies Imlib and Fnlib, and remains in heavy usage today.  While rumors
of its death still circulate, DR16.6 was release on Nov 2nd, 2003, and it remains
in development today with a long life still ahead of it.  DR16 has been the choice
of power users and artists due to its low overhead, highly graphical, widely theme-able,
extremely configurable, yet unobtrusive interface.  Nearly all functions of the window manager
can be handled without mouse input, including application launching via 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">e16keyedit</a>.
It also remains highly portable, with ports avalible for Linux on all platforms, FreeBSD,
IRIX, Solaris X86 and Sparc, HP-UX, AIX, OS/2, and more.
</p>  

<p>
Imlib has lived a long life, 
still in heavy usage today, as one of the most popular image manipulation and rendering
libs available.  Its development was taken over by the GNOME project and used as GNOMEs rendering
engine until it was replaced with GdkPixbuf in GNOME 2.0.  It's popularity surpasses just 
development in C thanks to bindings for several scripting languages including PERL, Python, and Ruby.

<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment Foundation Libraries</p>

<p>
In developing DR17 it was made clear that we needed an entirely new set of libraries and tools.  Raster had
a bold vision of what was possible and where he wanted the next release to go, starting with Imlib2 and EVAS,
and eventually growing into new libraries largely based on or around EVAS.  It became clear that 
the usefulness of these libraries and tools went far beyond the DR17 release itself, just as Imlib did in DR16.
Thus the collective library back-end of DR17 was given the independent title: the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries,
or EFL for short.
</p>

<p>
The EFL contains solutions for almost any graphical interface task, far beyond just rendering images.  EVAS provides
a highly optimized canvas library. Ecore provides a simple and modular abstraction interface and advanced event
management including timers.  Etox provides a complex text layout library complete with theme-able text stylization
capabilities (previously Estyle).
EDB provides a compact database format for intuitive and easy configuration management, including the storing
of binaries.  EET provides an integrated and flexible container that ends the traditions of providing themes in tarballs.
Edje provides a revolutionary library and tool set for <i>completely</i> abstracting application interfaces from their code,
including a complex and flexible method of designing interfaces.  EWL provides a complete widget library built
on all the other components of the EFL.  And more!

<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment DR17</p>

<p>
Development Release 17 of the Enlightenment window manager represents an evolution into the next generation
of desktop environments: <a href="faq-dr17.html">the desktop shell</a>.  DR17 will provide integration between
files and your environment in a seamless manner while encompassing a graphically rich and flexible architecture.
It will not compete with GNOME or KDE, but be a completely new way of visualizing your desktop, based around
the EFL which was built from the ground up for this task.
</p>

<p>
Still in heavy development, several applications that will be part of the DR17 release and examples
of what is possible are already available in CVS, such as Entice, Entrance, Evidence, Erss, and Eplayer.
The desktop shell itself is only a basic framework and not yet ready for CVS, but will be emerging 
into CVS during the course of this year.  As the foundation of DR17, the EFL is currently the first
and foremost priority for development.
