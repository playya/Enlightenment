Welcome to the new Enlightenment.Org.

<p>For the uninitiated, Enlightenment is a Window Manager for the
<a href="http://www.x.org/">X Windows System</a>, traditionally used in
Unix environments. See <a href="info.html">What is it?</a> for
more information, and get E <a href="download.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>For returning visitors, we're reorganizing the site to fix a number of
problems we've had in the past. This site is going to be more responsive. It's
going to be support and development geared, and we're going make improvements
to the site on a running basis. Also, we're going to pull in all the new
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/enlightenment/">SourceForge</a>
stuff we now have access to.</p>

<p>Currently, for support, you have three options: using irc (preferred; #e on
irc.openprojects.net), our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2">mailing lists</a>,
or email (use email addresses from the
<a href="team.html">team page</a>, but don't bug raster if you don't need to).
Suggestions are welcome.</p>
