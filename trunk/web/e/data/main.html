<p class="contenttitle">Welcome to the Enlightenment Project!</p>

<p>
Enlightenment is a completely themeable, highly configurable Window
Manager for the <a href="http://www.x.org/">X Window System</a>,
traditionally used in Unix environments.

<p>
For the latest information on changes to this website, resources and
the rest of the Enlightenment project, be sure to regularly check the
<a href="news.html">news page</a>. Full of newsy goodness!
</p>

<p>
The current, stable release of Enlightenment is 0.16.5 - available for your
perusal is the <a href="features-0.16.html">E 0.16 feature list</a> and the
<a href="docs.html">user documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The development effort for the 0.17 series is well underway and
a lot larger than for the 0.16 series, mainly because Enlightenment is
going to become a desktop shell. See the <a href="faq.html">FAQs</a>
to find out what this means and what not. The subsystems created along
the way for purposes of graphics handling, filesystem access etc are
organized in standalone libraries that can be used by other projects
as well.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, this site includes information about the
<a href="evas.html">Enlightenment Canvas Library (Evas)</a>, the imaging
library <a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a>,
the <a href="efsd.html">Enlightenment File System Daemon (Efsd)</a>, and 
the other <a href="components.html">components</a> of the Enlightenment
desktop shell. These systems are under active development - Imlib2 has been
stabilized but the others continue to evolve on a weekly or even daily basis.
</p>

<p>
If you want to jump right in and play with the development code, visit the <a
href="source.html">Source Code</a> page. To install the stable release of
Enlightenment, you can get everything that you need on the 
<a href="download.html">Downloads</a> page.

<p>
Currently, for support, you have three options: talking to developers and users
on irc (#E on <em>irc.openprojects.net</em>), our user and developer 
<a href="mail.html">mailing lists</a>, or as a last resort you can email us
directly - our addresses are on the <a href="team.html">team page</a>. We do ask
that you don't bug Raster directly if you don't need to, the poor lad's mailbox
is suffering enough as it is. Suggestions to the mailing lists are welcome.
