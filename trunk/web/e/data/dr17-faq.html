What is Enlightenment DR17?
@:news_body@
Enlightenment is a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your files.

<p align="center">Building from CVS</p>

@:news_title@
How do I get started?
@:news_body@
Obviously, the first thing to do is to checkout the code from CVS.  To do this you need to do the following:<br><br>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/enlightenment login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/enlightenment co e17
<br><br>
Once you have the code you should start building the code.  There are two subdirectories in e17, apps and libs.  You should build all the libs and then the apps.

What should I know and do before starting to build?
@:news_body@
DR17 requires the latest build tools.  You may have never had to worry about your build tools before, even if you compile software all the time, but DR17 has some very strict needs.  If you have old versions of the tools or misconfigured tools, even if they worked fine before, you will find the libs and apps frustrating and impossible to get built.  <br>
Listed below are several tools that you must have, and the <i>minimum</i> version you can use:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">GNU Autoconf</a> v2.50
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">GNU Automake</a> v1.4-p4
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">GNU Gettext</a> v0.10.35
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html">GNU Awk</a> v3.0.6
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</a> v3.79.1
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/binutils.html">GNU BinUtils</a> v2.10.91
</ul>
<! -- Do we wanna include GCC verions? Readline versions? Image Lib Verions
</ul>
<br>
Please realize that these are only the minium versions you can use.  Please try to use the latest versions of the tools.

@:news_title@
How can I find out which versions of the tools I have?
@:news_body@
Several ways.  You can use each command with a --version (ie: autoconf --version).  If you are on an RPM based distribution of Linux you can use "rpm -qa | grep autoconf".<br><br>
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
How can I update my tools?
@:news_body@
You can either check with you given distribution/platform distributor for the latest versions or compile them yourself from GNU sources.  However, if you choose to or need to build the tools on your own make sure that you <i>completely</i> remove any pre-installed versions by removing the RPMs, Deb's, or what have you.  Also, one common "gotcha" is that pre-installed tools for a distribution will be installed in /usr, whereas the GNU default install location from the source is /usr/local.  When you remove pre-installed tools often directories or libraries that are shared will not actually be removed, escpailly directories in /usr/share.  The most common of these is the "aclocal" directory; having an aclocal directory in /usr/share and /usr/local/share will make all sorts of bad things happen, particularlly in autogen.sh.  Always check that directories in /usr/share and /usr/local/share are not redundant.
<br>
If you are on an RPM based distro, please note that most packages such as the above mentioned tools are made up of TWO packages a "program-X.i386.rpm" and a "program-X-devel.i386.rpm".

What other software do I need installed before I build E?
@:news_body@
There are a few dependencies that E has that are not in the CVS module.  These should be installed and working before you try to start building E or it's libries.  Please note, these are <i>not</i> optional:
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/download/">FAM v2.6.4</a> or newer. 
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/libxml/">LibXML2 v2.4.5</a> or newer.
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/">PCRE v3.5</a> or newer.
</ul>
One more package that is highly recommended, but not required at the moment, is the latest version of <a href="http://www.ferite.org/?page=download">Ferite</a>, which will be used in the future.

How do I build each library and app?
@:news_body@
For each library or app, you should follow the same pattern. Here is an example using Imlib2:
<ol>
<li>Type: cd e17/libs/imlib2
<li>Type: ./autogen.sh
<li>Think: Did anything fail?  Was everything found? Did ./configure finish completely?
<li>Type: make
<li>Understand: You may see warnings.  Some aren't that bad, like pointer warnings.  Serious problems (errors) will stop the make proccess.
<li>Type: su
<li>Type: make install
<li>Look: Did any thing fail in the install proccess?
<li>Type: /sbin/ldconfig
<li>Type: exit (to leave root for your normal user account)
<li>If possible, try the test app, like EVAS's evas_test or EWL's ewl_test.
</ol>
Many users are unfamilar with ldconfig.  You <i>must</i> run ldconfig after each library installation, otherwise the library will be installed but will not actually be used.  Very often when you try to configure (using ./autogen.sh or ./configure) an application and it mysteriously can't find a library you just installed it's because you didn't run ldconfig.  Make sure that "/usr/local/lib" is in your /etc/ld.so.conf, so that it looks for the libraries there, or whichever directory you are installing libraries into.

My build tools are up-to-date and I'm ready.  What should I build first?
@:news_body@
Once you are ready to build, follow the following order:
