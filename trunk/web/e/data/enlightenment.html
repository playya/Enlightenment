<p>Enlightenment is currently under <i>heavy</i> developement.  It's full feature set is, as yet, still largely open.
Being built upon Ecore, Ebits, Imlib2 and EVAS make the possiblities wide open.  For instance, under E17 you will have
the option of running E as hardware rendered!</p>
<p>Check back to this page over time to see what new features are appering in E.  If you wish to try it yourself you 
can look at <a href="source.html">cvs</a> and build it yourself.
