<p>
The upcoming release 0.17 of Enlightenment is still under development.
As stated in the <a href="estatus.html">State of the E-nion</a> document
that was published in March 2003, the version presently in CVS was a
glorified test app, and is now deprecated -- it will not compile against
present versions of the Enlightenment libraries. Development is already
underway for the real E17, now that most of the EFL libraries are getting
to a mature stage.</p>

<p>Come back to this page again to stay informed about E 0.17's development
progress and current features.</p>
