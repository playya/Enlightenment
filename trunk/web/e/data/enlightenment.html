<p>
The upcoming release 0.17 of Enlightenment is still under developement.
At the moment it is a fully operational basic window manager without
most of the features that the stable 0.16.5 release provides, and the
beginnings of the file manager. It uses most of the
<a href="components.html">components</a> listed on the left -- the file
system handling is already done by <a href="efsd.html">Efsd</a>,
and that the graphics backend is entirely handled by
<a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a> and <a href="evas.html">Evas</a>.
</p>

<p>
Come back to this page again to stay informed about E 17's current features.
If you wish to test E 17 right now, please have a look at the
<a href="source.html">CVS</a> code and build it yourself.
