<p>
The upcoming release 0.17 of Enlightenment is still under development.
At the moment it is a fully operational basic window manager without
most of the features that the stable 0.16.5 release provides, and the
beginnings of the file manager. It uses most of the
<a href="components.html">components</a> listed on the left -- the file
system handling is already done by <a href="efsd.html">Efsd</a>,
and that the graphics backend is entirely handled by
<a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a> and <a href="evas.html">Evas</a>.
</p>

<p>
Come back to this page again to stay informed about E 0.17's current
features.  If you wish to test E 0.17 right now, please have a look at
the <a href="source.html">CVS</a> code and build it yourself.
</p>

<p>
Please note that E 0.17 is intended for use only by developers and
those who have the time and programming skill to help out.  If you
cannot get it to build and run on your own, please do not ask the
developers for help.  Simply wait until it is released and ready for
public consumption.</p>
