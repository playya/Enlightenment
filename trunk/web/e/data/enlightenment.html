<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment DR17: The Window Manager</p>
<br>

<p>
On Nov 24th 2004 Enlightenment DR17's codebase was checked into our CVS repository.
</p>

<p>
The 17th Development Release (DR17) of the Enlightenment Window Manager brings together
more than 3 years of development on its underlying technology: the <a href="efl.html">Enlightenment
Foundation Libraries</a>.  Imlib2 provides the fastest image proccessing of any general purpose
C graphics library avalible.  EDB and EET provide unparalleled ease for componant packaging (EET) and
database storage (EDB).  EVAS provides the most powerful and flexable C canvas library on the planet.
Ecore provides robust event management and an extensable framework for general functionality such 
as X and LinuxFB abstraction, IPC, Sockets, and more.  Edje provides the worlds most revolutionary
interface abstraction capabilities including advanced visual effects and full animation.  Embryo
extends Edje's capabilties by adding scripts directly to the interface descriptions.
By leveraging all of these componants and more DR17 allows for more functionality, more eye candy, 
more customization, and more flexability than any other window manager in history.
Each release of the Enlightenment Window Manager has set the standard and the DR17 release will
push the desktop years beyond what is expected today.

<p>
In order to build the DR17 window manager you'll need to install the <a href="efl.html">Enlightenment Foundation Libraries</a>.
Feel free to <a href="source.html">browse the CVS tree</a> but please <a href="cvsnotes.html">read the build notes before
seeking help</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best way to see DR17 in action is <a href="/e17_movie-01.avi">to watch the video</a>.  Because
of the animation and effects that <a href="edje.html">Edje</a> provides to the new window manager screenshots do it no
justice, but none the less here they are:

<p>
For those who choose to run Enlightenment DR17, icons can be added by 
untaring /usr/local/share/enlightenment/data/other/favorite_apps.tar.gz into ~/.e/e/applications/favorite
and then copy over the EETs that you want on the iconbar into the ~/.e/e/applications/bar directory.
