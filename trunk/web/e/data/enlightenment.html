<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment DR17: The Window Manager</p>
<br>

<p>
The upcoming release of DR17 is still under development.
As stated in the <a href="estatus.html">State of the E-nion</a> document
that was published in March 2003, the version presently in CVS was a
glorified test app, and is now deprecated -- it will not compile against
present versions of the Enlightenment libraries. Development is already
underway for the real E17, now that most of the EFL libraries are getting
to a mature stage.</p>

<p>
The DR17 is now in early re-write, however it is nothing more than a code
framework at this point, even if you did find the code it would only
show you a dialog window.  Nothing more.  No menus, no controls, no anything.
At this point, emphisis is still on developing the EFL, since that is the
real power center of DR17.

progress and current features.</p>
