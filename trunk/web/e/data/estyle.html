<p>Estyle is an EVAS based text stylization library that makes adding stylized text with effects to any EVAS application simple.  The API is small and easy to learn, loading text effects from an Estyle EDB file (eg: blurred.style.db) and applying them to your EVAS text.</p>

<p>Estyle.db's consist of several key/value pairs describing how the text to be rendered should be manuipulated using multiple layers.  Each layer can have a diffrent color, alpha channel value, size, offset in both x and y independantly, and stacking value.  Manipulating each of these values and becoming creative with stacking each layer a number of interesting and unique effects can be added to your text, in a simple, reusable manner.</p>
