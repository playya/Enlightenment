<p class="contenttitle">Elicit</p>

<p>
Elicit is a tool for examining images on your desktop, providing 
both a global color picker and a zoom tool.  Graphic artists and 
designers can quickly examine graphics without needed to rely on 
larger tools such as GIMP for simple examinations and color checks.
Elicit is especially useful for theme development and spot checking.

Here is a shot of Elicit in action:

<p>
To use Elicit, just hold down your left mouse button over either the
color picker tool or the zoom tool and while holding move your cursor 
to any place on your desktop.  The default winter theme (pictured above)
puts the color and zoom information on a pullout which can be moved out 
(as pictured) or pushed in when not needed.  The arrows next to each value
on the info pullout allow you to change the zoom level or make minor color
changes to the selected color.  Anyone who works on graphics will wonder
how they lived without this tool.

Elicit is built on top of the EFL and fully Edje themeable.
