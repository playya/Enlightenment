What is the Enlightenment project?
@:news_body@
Enlightenment began as a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your <a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net">files</a>.

Whats the history of the project?
@:news_body@
<p>
Enlightenment has a long and glorious past.  When Raster was going attending University of New South Wales
he began working with the newly released <a href="http://www.cactii.net/~bb/XawXpm/">Xaw-Xpm</a>.
Leveraging Xaw-Xpm, he hacked up a new version of FVWM, which he called "FVWM-XPM".  This new and improved
FVWM allowed XPM images to be used in place of ugly Athena Widgets (FVWM started out in 1992 based on TWM).

<p>
On Oct 30th, 1996, <a href="https://oldwww.losurs.org/docs/rhlibrary/cola/volume96/Oct/961030.68">Raster 
released the first version of Enlightenment</a>.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.devolution.com">devolution.com</a>
you can <a href="http://www.devolution.com/enlightenment/index.html">see Raster's old Enlightenment web page</a>.
During E's infancy it had been derived from FVWM2's codebase, something that quickly changed as complete
rewrites of the window manager occured.  By DR8 (E 0.8) the code was moved from using LibXPM to using Raster's
own <a href="http://www.devolution.com/enlightenment/imlib.html">Imlib</a> which was included with the window 
manager code untill DR10 when it was released as a stand alone library in 1997.

<a name="Release"></a>
Why hasn't Enlightenment had a new major release in 3 years!?!
@:news_body@
Extensive work has been done creating a set of foundation libraries for the next Enlightenment release for more information see the <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
We know it has been a long frustrating wait for users and we appreciate everyone's patience. Enlightenment has a long proud history of producing the best ahead-of-it's-time eye-candy on the planet that is emulated for years to come, and we have no desire to release a half assed product just to make people happy for 2 or 3 days until they start complaining.  The results will be well worth the wait.

What is the meaning of the release versions: E 17 and DR17 or 0.17?
@:news_body@
"DR" stands for Development Release.  The current stable window manager can be called any of the following, E 0.16.5, E 16.5 or DR16.5 it's all the same thing.  Which you use is a matter of personal preference.

We can always use a hand.  Create themes or backgrounds, write documention or tutorials, and help others around you and on IRC.  If you've always wanted to code, the <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL</a> will make it easy for you, so start learning and share your experience with others in the form of a tutorial.
