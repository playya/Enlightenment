<p class="contenttitle">Etox</p>
<p>Etox is a type setting and manipulation library that works in conjunction with EVAS.  Using Etox you can manipulate text in almost any way you could possibly image, and some that you couldn't.  These text manipulations include displaying, moving, resizing, layering, clipping, alignment, coloring, fonts, styles, and more.  Because Etox treats text as an object you are provided alot of flexablility in how its manipulated, not to mention the ease.</p>
<p>Consider an example: you want to place several lines of text in a window, and then include several images, but you want the text to dynamically wrap itself around the images anytime you move an image.  Etox can do this with ease.  See the following images showing just that...</p>
<p><img src="img/etox-image1.png"></p>
<p><img src="img/etox-image2.png"></p>
<p>In the first image we have several lines of text wrapped around three images.  In the second image I've rearranged the images and the text has dynamically wrapped itself around the new image locations.  As you can see, Etox can provide a number of unique options for text display in your application.</p>
<p>Etox is still in development and authored by Mandrake, Adam Kisiel, and BLAdER.   Their contact details can be found on the
