<p class="contenttitle">Etox</p>
<p>Etox is a type setting and text layout library based on
    <a href="evas.html">Evas</a>.  Etox helps you when it
    comes to displaying, moving, resizing, layering, clipping,
    aligning and coloring fonts in different styles, and more.</p>
<p>A typical application is the need for a text layout engine
 that can dynamically arrange text flow around other graphical
 obstacles. See the following images illustrating just that.</p>

<p>Etox is still in development and authored by Mandrake, Adam Kisiel,
    and BLAdER. Their contact details can be found on the
<a href="team.html">team page</a>.</p>
