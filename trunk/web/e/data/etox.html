<p>Etox is a type setting and text layout library based on
    <a href="evas.html">Evas</a>.  Etox helps you when it
    comes to displaying, moving, resizing, layering, clipping,
    aligning and coloring fonts in different styles, and more.</p>


<p>A typical application is the need for a text layout engine
 that can dynamically arrange text flow around other graphical
 obstacles. See the following images illustrating just that.</p>
