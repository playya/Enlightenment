<p>
eRSS is a simple tool for watching RSS v1 (RDF) and v2 (XML) feeds.  By creating simple
config files you can definate how each feed is monitored, by including a clock, spedifying
what information is displayed, the feed title, and how often its updated.  Feeds can 
be displayed either bordered (a conventional window) or borderless for embedding in your desktop 
(pictured below).  Each feed is its own proccess allowing you to start and stop diffrent
feeds individually.

<p>
Here is a desktop with 4 diffrent feeds being shown.  The Mozilla sessions were opened
by clicking on an RSS topic.  Notice that in the bottom right you can see the description
of an RSS topic by holding your cursor over it...

<p>
Enlightenment DR16 users can "embed" eRSS feeds on their desktop by moving and positioning
them where they like using ALT-Mouse1 and ALT-Mouse3, and then ALT-Mouse2 to set the
stacking layer to "Bottom", toggling Window Skip List, then "Stick" it.  Now the
feed will follow you anywhere you go!  Use DR16's "Remember" feature and put
the execution line (erss -c something.cfg &) in your .xinitrc to have your feeds
started automatically every time.

<p>
eRSS is built on top of the EFL and fully Edje themeable.
