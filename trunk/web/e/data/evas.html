Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw
anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend, as well
as drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps, lines and
rectangles for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are too slow.
@:para@
Evas provides a structured mode graphics API and thus provides a set of
objects as primities to work with. As opposed to immediate mode where the 
program actually draws the data, with structured mode the program describes 
the data with primitives and lest the canvas handle the drawing. This means
the program has to describe what it wants to draw in terms of the primitives
given. Here is a list of them.

One of the most versatile and appealing objects is the image object. You
simple tell Evas where the image file is located, where to put the image
what size the object is to be and how to fill the image object with the
image data, and Evas handles the rest. This makes dealing with images in
Evas childs play. Here is a quick example of how it would work:
@:para@
<pre>
object = evas_add_image_from_file(evas, "flower.png");
evas_move(evas, object, 10.0, 30.0);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre>
@:para@
And it would look something like this:
@:para@
<a href=evas_image_eg_0.html><img src=img/evas_image_eg_0_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
@:para@
By default image bojects are the size of the original image (in pixels). If
we wish to make the object larger and have the image scale up or down in
size we could do:
@:para@
<pre>
evas_resize(evas, object, 320.0, 240.0);
evas_set_image_fill(evas, object, 0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 240.0);
</pre>
@:para@
Now our canvas would look like this:
@:para@
<a href=evas_image_eg_1.html><img src=img/evas_image_eg_1_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
@:para@
Easy, isn't it? now lets say we want to have a 300x200 unit rectangle filled
with this image we loaded, but we want it to tile (repeat) starting the tile
at coordinate 0,0 relative to the to-left corner of the image object area,
but have the tiled image size be 20x50.
@:para@
<pre>
evas_resize(evas, object, 300.0, 200.0);
evas_set_image_fill(evas, object, 0.0, 0.0, 20.0, 50.0);
</pre>
@:para@
Out result would be something like this:
@:para@
<a href=evas_image_eg_2.html><img src=img/evas_image_eg_2_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
@:para@
As you can see - the program has to know and do very little. There are many
powerful things you can do, like fade images in and out, re-color them so
they look tinted, have them rendered only within a certain area of the
canvas and more.
