Wed Nov 7 - <a href="mailto:benr@@cuddletech.com">benr</a> - Exciting time for Enlightenment
@:news_body@
The last several weeks have been very exciting.  Many of the diffrent peices 
of the Enlightenment puzzle are really starting to come together.  Though 
DR17 isn't ready for most eyes yet, the libraries and applications that support it are coming 
along beautifully.  If you are an experienced programmer I suggest looking into
<a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a> and <a href="evas.html">EVAS</a>.  For some real 
magic look at <a href="ebits.html">Ebits</a> and <a href="edb.html">Edb</a>.  And for the
higher level or newer programmers take a look at <a href="ewl.html">EWL</a> and 
<a href="ewd.html">Ewd</a>.  There is something for everyone, whether you plan to use
the window manager or not.  Real magic is coming from the E developers, please feel
free to check <a href="source.html">CVS</a> and have a look for yourself.

Sat Oct 13 - Andrew S - New mailing list archives
@:news_body@
Huzzah! Though our current mailing list archiving service, Geocrawler,
continues to <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/about/">run on autopilot</a>
and cannot archive new lists, the friendly people at MARC are now archiving
all of our lists (including enlightenment-users). The MARC service includes
the ability to search through archived messages. Props go to Claus Niesen
for getting the e-users list added and letting us know - thanks Claus! For
more information, head on over to the enlightenment.org 
<a href="mail.html">mailing list page</a>.

Fri Jul 27 - <a href="mailto:term@@NO.SPAMkempler.net">Term</a> - More documentation
@:news_body@
We haven't updated the news in a while, but not a lot has been happening
recently. <a href="mailto:cK@@NO.SPAMwhoop.org">cK</a> continues working on
efsd, and <a href="mailto:raster@@NO.SPAMrasterman.com">raster</a> has started
coding again, after spending a lot of time writing a very complete
<a href="pdf/evas.pdf">PDF</a> documenting Evas. I finally got around to
<a href="htmlized/evas/">htmlizing</a>, too. Check it out.

Sat Jun 02 - <a href="mailto:cK@@NO.SPAMwhoop.org">cK</a> - Website redesign
@:news_body@
Finished a general website overhaul, added a stylesheet and began a FAQ section.
I hope you like the new looks. Btw, no, we're not dead -- unfortunately the
active developers are pretty busy right now, so please be patient :)

Sun Apr 22 - <a href="mailto:term@@NO.SPAMkempler.net">Term</a> - Website fixup
@:news_body@
After a lot of ranting and arguing on the development mailing list, I decided
to jump earlier than I expected to and make some changes. No more spinning
logo. No more png files (a note to browser authors: shame on you for supporting
them so horribly, that is not anyone's idea of "web compliant"). Etc. Send
change requests to me.

Sun Apr 15 - <a href="mailto:raster@@NO.SPAMrasterman.com">Raster</a> - Website redo
@:news_body@
Tonight the website got reformatted and done. It got cleaned up and now has
configuration files and templates so the look is very easily separated from
the feel. It has build scripts and has a new (cleaner) look to it. It is not
complete, but it will be filled in over time.
