<p>EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is needed, and it was much simpler to impliment this once here.</p>

<p>Eet is extremely fast, small and simple. Eet files can be very small and highly compressed, making them very optimal for just sending across the internet without having to archive, compress or decompress and install them. They allow for lightning-fast random-acess reads once created, making them perfect for storing data that is written once (or rarely) and read many times, but the program does not want to have to read it all in at once.</p>

<p>It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as image data for saving to Eet files or sending across the network to other machines, or just writing to arbitary files on the system. All data is encoded in a platform independant way and can be written and read by any architecture.</p>

<p>Code Example:</p>

<div class="code">

<pre>
#include &lt;Eet.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  Eet_File *ef;
  char buf[1024], *ret, **list;
  int size, num, i;

  strcpy(buf, "Here is a string of data to save!");

  ef = eet_open("/tmp/my_file.eet, EET_FILE_MODE_WRITE);
  if (!ef) return -1;
  if (!eet_write(ef, "/key/to_store/at", buf, 1024, 1))
    fprintf("Error writing data!\n");
  eet_close(ef);

  ef = eet_open("/tmp/my_file.eet, EET_FILE_MODE_READ);
  if (!ef) return -1;
  list = eet_list(ef, "*", &num);
  if (list)
    {
      for (i = 0; i &lt; num; i++)
        printf("Key stored: %s\n", list[i]);
      free(list);
    }
  ret = eet_read(ef, "/key/to_store/at", &size);
  if (ret)
    {
      printf("Data read (%i bytes):\n%s\n", size, ret);
      free(ret);
    }
  eet_close(ef);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>This code is compiled in the following manner: gcc `eet-config --libs --cflags` eet_example.c -o eet_example</p>

<p>
EET also provides the CLI "eet" tool which allows for easy EET 
management and creation.  Supported operations with the tool include
listing the contents of an eet file, and both packing and unpacking 
of an eet file, as well as some compression control over files to 
be packed.
