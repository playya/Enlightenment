<p>
Enlightenment is a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
</p>
<p>
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your files.
</p>
<p>
We're currently hard at work building the next revision (0.17) of
Enlightenment.

@:news_title@
What exactly do you mean by "E 17 will become a desktop shell?"
@:news_body@
It means that E 17 combines features of a window manager and a file manager.
It will provide nicely integrated GUI elements for managing your desktop
elements, both files and windows. It does *not* mean that E 17 is another
application framework like Gnome and KDE.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Will E 16's themes work with E 17?
@:news_body@
No. The theme formats are totally different. There is a chance though
that converters will exist at some point.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What's E's relation to Gnome and KDE? Is Gnome supported? Is KDE supported?
@:news_body@
E 16 supports both Gnome and KDE. In E 17, you will be able to use both Gnome
and KDE *applications*. However, given that E 17 will be a desktop shell, this
doesn't mean that all parts of the frameworks (such as desktop-oriented filemanagers)
will work.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What platforms does E run on?
@:news_body@
The primary development platform is Linux. *BSD and Solaris are
also supported. HP, Irix, AIX should more or less work, but are
probably adventurous.

@:news_title@
I'd like to contribute! How can I commit code?
@:news_body@
Send patches! If they're good you'll get a CVS account.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
When will E 17 be released?
@:news_body@
HAHAHAHAHAHA :)

@:news_title@
My epplets keep multiplying whenever I launch E. Help!
@:news_body@
That's a bug in the Epplet library. For the adventurous, you need to
remove all bogus epplet entries from
~/.enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 while E isn't
running. A more radical approach is to simply delete this file --
this may cause other settings to be lost, such as those for the
icon box and the pagers. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<p align="center">Efsd</p>

@:news_title@
I heard Efsd needs FAM. What's that? What's Imon?
@:news_body@
FAM is the File Alteration Monitor, a server which reports
file modification events to clients. Imon is a Linux kernel patch
to improve performance, using it is highly recommended.
Read more about it at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Can I run Efsd without FAM? Do I need Imon?
@:news_body@
At the moment, FAM is necessary to run Efsd. You can get
both FAM and Imon at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>. If the
server is down, we have a local copy of FAM's sources up on our
SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
This version also fixes an annoying compilation bug.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I can't compile FAM. It dies with a "`NULL' undeclared (first use this function)" message.
@:news_body@
Add the line "#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;" to BTree.h. Alternatively, you can download
our copy which has this problem fixed on our SourceForge
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.

@:news_title@
Why don't you add support for browsing FTP, Tarballs etc to Efsd?
@:news_body@
Because that's not Efsd's job. Efsd's job is to provide a facility
for launching fs commands and asynchronously receiving replies *on
top* of the fs, not to extend the fs.
