<p class="contenttitle">Ewler</p>

<p>
Ewler is a user interface design tool to help speed development of
<a href="ewl.html">ewl</a> applications.  It works with the existing ewl
base widgets, and new widget descriptions can be loaded dynamically, even
allowing for the new widgets to appear in the ui editor.  Simple forms up
to full projects with custom edjes can be managed with ewler.
</p>

<p>
Ewler is founded on principles similar to GTK+'s Glade and Qt's designer.
Projects contain forms and source files, all managed by a project system.
Makefiles can be automatically generated with helper tools, and the xml ui
outputs are compiled into C to generate full ewl applications.  The widgets
available to the system are described in xml datasheets as well, and new
custom widgets can be described in xml and linked to in either dynamic
libraries or static modules.
</p>

<p>
Formal downloads of ewler are as yet unavailable, but development versions
can be obtained by anyone wishing to help out or experiment by contacting
<a href="mailto:werkt@@users.sourceforge.net">werkt</a>.
</p>

<p>
Ewler is built on top of the EFL and fully Edje themeable.
