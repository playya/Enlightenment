<p class="contenttitle">Ewler</p>

<p>
Ewler is a user interface design tool to help speed development of
<a href="ewl.html">ewl</a> applications.  It works with the existing ewl
base widgets, and new widget descriptions can be loaded dynamically, even
allowing for the new widgets to appear in the ui editor.  Simple forms up
to full projects with custom edjes can be managed with ewler.

<p>
Here is a shot of Ewler in action:

<p>
Ewler is founded on principles similar to GTK+'s Glade and Qt's designer.
Projects contain forms and source files, all managed by a project system.
Makefiles can be automatically generated with helper tools, and the xml ui
outputs are compiled into C to generate full ewl applications.  The widgets
available to the system are described in xml datasheets as well, and new
custom widgets can be described in xml and linked to in either dynamic
libraries or static modules.
</p>

<p>
Ewler is available in cvs under the misc module, and feel free to email 
<a href="mailto:werkt@@users.sourceforge.net">werkt</a> with any questions or
suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Ewler is built on top of the EFL and fully Edje themeable.
