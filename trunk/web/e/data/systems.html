<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment's Core Systems</p>
<br>

<p>
Enlightenment has grown to be much more than a window manager. It has many
systems that have grown on their own to support development of the next
version (0.17) and all the effort is going into solidifying these systems to
be more than solid to build on. This has lead to a lot of code being produced
that is useful far and beyond a window manager. The idea is to share as much
code as possible with other programs, and so a small army of shared libraries
has evolved for Enlightenment. This page attempts to cover some of these
(especially the more interesting ones) to give a good insight into why they
exist, what they do, how to use them, and where they are going.
</p><p>
We refer to these systems as the <a href=efl.html>EFL or Enlightenment
Foundation Libraries</a>, as they are the foundation of the project and the
currently contain all the hard work. The intent is to have libraries that are
extremely easy to use and learn, that optimize automatically for the programmer
where possible and svage the programmer time and effort in the long run. We
believe we have achieved many of these goals and have some very unique
aspects that may be of great interest to developers outside of the project to
create some interesting or even amazing tools.
