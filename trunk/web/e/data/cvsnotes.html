<p class="contenttitle">E17 CVS Build Notes</p>
<p>After getting E17 from CVS you'll go through the length task of building each
of its dependencies. Below you'll find an ordered list that will help you build
E. Please note that when we say "build" we're talking about a four stage
process of: ./autogen.sh, ./configure (if autogen.sh doesn't run it for you),
make, make install. If all goes well you should shoot right through the list. If
you have previously installed E17 and its libs your order will be different,
this list is for fresh installs only. It is generally recommended that any
existing installations of E17 or any of its components be completely removed
prior to a build, to avoid the problem we often see where the wrong versions of
the libraries get linked.</p>

<p>After the build is complete you should make sure FAM is running, edit your
.xinitrc and startx.</p>

<p>Currently no support is available for E17 build issues. Don't contact the
developers directly unless you are positive you've found a bug! Thanks.</p>
