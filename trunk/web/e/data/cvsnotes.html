<p class="contenttitle">E17 CVS Build Notes</p>
<p>After getting the e17 module from CVS you'll go through the lengthy task of building each
of its componants. Below you'll find an ordered list that will help you build
E. Please note that when we say "build" we're talking about a five stage
process of: ./autogen.sh, ./configure (if autogen.sh doesn't run it for you),
make, make install, and ldconfig. If all goes well you should shoot right through the list. 
</p>

<p><strong>If you have problems building the source, the most common problems involve
old versions of the build tools.  If you can't even get autogen.sh to run properly
you should check versions of libtool, automake, autoconf, and gettext.
Present versions recommended are GNU m4 1.4, autoconf 2.54, automake 1.7, libtool 1.4.3, and gettext 0.11.5.
It's also common to have problems with multiple aclocal directories (ie: both /usr/share/aclocal 
and /usr/local/share/aclocal) which you should fix by moving the contents from one to the other, then
remove (or move) the directory and symlink it to the place that you copied the ac's to, that way both
aclocal directories point to the same place.</strong></p>

<p><strong>
CVS normally builds fine.  Breakage occurs from time to time and will be fixed when the developers get a chance.  The denizens of #e do not look fondly on questions about build errors from CVS.  You have been warned!
</strong></p>

<p>E CVS is actively tested and developed on the following platforms: Linux/X86, Linux/PPC, Linux/Sparc, Linux/HP-PA,  Solaris/SPARC, HP-UX/HP-PA and FreeBSD/x86.</p>
