      <td>Adding new backgrounds to E is easy.  Just copy them into .enlightenment/backgrounds and restart!
	You can create background submenus by simply creating a directory.  Backgrounds can be accessed
	from the main "middle-click" menus of via the Desktop Background Settings dialog.

      <td>The bar at the top of your desktop (by default) is the desktop dragbar.  You can drag
	windows between or look at two diffrent desktops by simply dragging the desktop down!
	You can also see a tooltip in this shot.  Holding your cursor of some part of Enlightenment will
	present you with a tooltip summorizing how to use that componant, if you've enabled tooltips.

      <td>Each window can be hand crafted to meet your needs.  Change stacking, border style, stick
	or unstick (follows you from virtual desktop to virtual desktop), or toggle the window skip 
	list.  You can even "remember" these settings for use by other windows of the same kind.
	This is very useful for "embedding" application into your desktop, such as GKRELLM.

      <td>Take full control of your desktop using our advanced tools, such as Eesh (the Enlightenment Shell)
	to interact directly with the window manager, and the optional e16keyedit which can be used
	to edit all Enlightenment keybindings and even add your own.  In this shot I've just bound Control-Shift-F5 to
	open a new Eterm.

	ensure that the theme is named theme_name.etheme (Freshmeat automatically renames them to tar.gz).
	Then copy the theme into .enlightenment/themes/ and restart E. Look in the Themes menu and you'll see it there,
	ready to be used!
