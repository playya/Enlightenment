What is Enlightenment?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Enlightenment is a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your files.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
What's E's relation to Gnome and KDE? Is Gnome supported? Is KDE supported?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
E 16 supports both Gnome and KDE. In E 17, you will be able to use both Gnome
and KDE *applications*. However, given that E 17 will be a desktop shell, this
doesn't mean that all parts of the frameworks (such as desktop-oriented file managers)
will work.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
What platforms does E run on?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
The primary development platform is Linux. *BSD and Solaris are
also supported. HP, Irix, AIX should more or less work, but are
probably adventurous.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
I'd like to contribute! How can I commit code?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Send patches! If they're good you'll get a CVS account.

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
My epplets keep multiplying whenever I launch E. Help!
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
That's a bug in the Epplet library. For the adventurous, you need to
remove all bogus epplet entries from
~/.enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 while E isn't
running. A more radical approach is to simply delete this file --
this may cause other settings to be lost, such as those for the
icon box and the pagers. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<p align="center">E17</p>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
When will E 17 be released?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
The release date for E17 is sometime in the distant future; a date
unknown yet even to the developers themselves. The release day in fact will 
probably be something that just happens one day and not something in
anyway planned.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
What exactly do you mean by "E 17 will become a desktop shell?"
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
It means that E 17 combines features of a window manager and a file manager.
It will provide nicely integrated GUI elements for managing your desktop
elements, both files and windows. It does *not* mean that E 17 is another
application framework like Gnome and KDE.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Will E 16's themes work with E 17?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
No. The theme formats are totally different. There is a chance though
that converters will exist at some point.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Will the epplets in E16 work under E17?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
No. The API for epplets under E17 will be completely different and
therefore old epplets will not work.
</td></tr></table>

<p align="center">EFSD</p>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
I heard EFSD needs FAM. What's that? What's Imon?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
FAM is the File Alteration Monitor, a server which reports
file modification events to clients. Imon is a Linux kernel patch
to improve performance, using it is highly recommended.
Read more about it at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Can I run EFSD without FAM? Do I need Imon?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
At the moment, FAM is necessary to run EFSD. Imon is not required in
order to use FAM/EFSD, but is recommended. You can get
both FAM and Imon at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>. If the
server is down, we have a local copy of FAM's sources up on our
SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
This version also fixes an annoying compilation bug.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
I can't compile FAM. It dies with a "`NULL' undeclared (first use this function)" message.
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Add the line "#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;" to BTree.h. Alternatively, you can download
our copy which has this problem fixed on our SourceForge
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Why don't you add support for browsing FTP, Tarballs etc to EFSD?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Because that's not EFSD's job. EFSD's job is to provide a facility
for launching file system commands and asynchronously receiving replies *on
top* of the file system, not to extend it.

<p align="center">EVAS</p>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
<a name="a"></a>
Why is EVAS faster with software acceleration than than when I run it
with hardware acceleration switched on?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
When run with hardware acceleration EVAS uses the GL libraries on your
system; this means that if you have Mesa installed then EVAS will use
the Mesa GL liberties. Mesa however only provides software acceleration
and therefore will run slow compared to EVAS's in-built software mode. If
you have a video card that supports hardware acceleration then you should
attempt to get the manufacturers own GL drivers for your computer and
install them making sure that none of the Mesa libraries are left behind
and that where needed symbolic links are made to the real drivers.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
<a name="b"></a>
Why is 'program x' which uses EVAS so slow?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
See last question. The chance is that the program is trying to use
hardware acceleration by default and that you have Mesa GL libraries
installed on your system. If you don't have acceleration on your video
card then you should search for a way to switch to software acceleration
in the program.

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">

Is there a packaged version of SGI's GLU Implementation for my computer
anywhere?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
At present SGI's GLU Implementation is available only in the form of a
RedHat package from <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html">
http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html</a>. You should
download this package and convert it to whatever distribution you are
on using "alien".
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
<a name="d"></a>
Why is my CPU usage at 100% when I use a program running EVAS?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
When used in software mode, EVAS will use a lot of CPU. In hardware
mode however it depends on your OpenGL drivers. What a lot of drivers
do is limit buffer buffer swaps to vertical blanking gaps only. This
means that the buffers wont be swapped until the vertical blanking gap
is reached, however since there is no method of using interrupts under
Linux/X the GL drivers have to poll in a tight loop waiting for the gap.
Also if the GL libraries are accessing the GFX hardware directory then if the
hardware is busy then the app will sit and poll registers until the
hardware is ready. It's basically down to your OpenGL drivers. It's worth
noting as well that your CPU will be high whenever you run evas_test as
it is pushing your system to try and achieve the highest frame rate it
can, a situation that most software using EVAS will never be in.
