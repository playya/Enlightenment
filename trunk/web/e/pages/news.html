Thur Mar 28 -  <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - DR17 kicks into high gear
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
I'm very happy to report that progress is happening rapidly and there are very tangible results.
Long months were spent working on the libraries which formed the foundation of DR17, and it has
paid off in a very nice windowing environment that is fairly usable.  However, because the focus
has been on developing these libraries, the Enlightenment "window manager" is still merely a shell
by which to test, and not a true taste of what will exist when it nears completion.  Though it 
does look very appealing in screen shots, do not judge it by what it is today because there is a lot
more to come.
<br>
Some of the real magic is happening right now on the components that will form the file management
aspects of DR17, which will be isolated from the E package directly.  Originally these functions
were to be built directly into E, however the developers felt it would be wiser to build separate 
libraries to handle these functions to allow for easier maintenance and expansion, and hence a cleaner
more distinct back end.  For people who have used DR17 and wondered why they can't do much more than
copy files between views, this is the work that will interest you.
<br>
The development that I just mentioned is currently happening in a separate branch of CVS.
The reason being that the developers realized that many people are currently
using and experimenting with DR17 from CVS, and their work is going to break most of the modules
for a while as they get the core work done, this allows them to work without bothering users. 
We should all be thankful that they did this, so we can all continue to enjoy DR17 while they work.
There is currently, as always, no time frame as to when they will be done, and there will naturally
be some problems, but when the development gets to a point that the developers feel it's ready, they
will be integrating the code back into the main CVS modules.  Until then it is recommended that 
anyone developing based on current CVS be aware that any changes they make could be impacted by the
merge when they are done and to be prepared for any conflicts, should they occur.

Sun Mar 3 - <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Its time to get to work
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
If you are one of the casual watchers of the Enlightenment project and don't watch the mailing lists
or the CVS commit list you're really missing some magic.  Though it may appear that the project is moving
along slowly, consider its complexity and scope.  Just look at the <a href="components.html">components list</a>.
A lot has been done and a lot more is coming. 
<br>
DR17 has progressed to a point now where its time for interested parties to start lending a hand.  
<a href="etcher.html">Etcher</a> and <a href="ebony.html">Ebony</a> are still under development, but the
tools are very usable.  It's time to start getting themes ready for Enlightenment and EWL.   This is by 
no means a suggestion that Enlightenment or EWL are ready for wide use, but if you are one of the people
who always wanted to get involved in a project but didn't know how you could help, here is your cue.
You can find a tutorial on Etcher and Ebony on the <a href="docs.html">docs page</a>.  You'll find Etcher
intimidating at first, but will quickly learn to love it and the possibilities and ease it provides.  Enjoy.

Sat Jan 19 - <a href="mailto:cK@NO.SPAMwhoop.org">cK</a> - The webpage is back (again :)
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Thanks to Term's efforts the webpage finally updates again out of CVS. Yay!
Things have changed a good deal since the last news update -- things are going
a good deal slower as before, mainly because nobody around is able to spend a
large amount of time on the code right now. This is a great time if you want
to become involved -- read the code, get familiar with it, come to the
developer's list and ask questions. Discussions there are gaining a good
deal of momentum right now. Brian Mattern (aka rephorm) has put a lot of
effort into making the next generation of epplets happen, you're welcome
to have a look and give it a try.

Our apologies for the recent downtime of the website, it is back in full swing
now. If you're interested in the E17 codebase but didn't know where to
start, we have a documentation system in place now for every module, and
documentation is growing. Please refer to the doc subdirectory of each
module for details. HTML versions of the manuals will be put up shortly.

The last several weeks have been very exciting.  Most of the different modules
of Enlightenment are used now in E17. Though the CVS codebase isn't ready for
public consumption yet, the libraries and applications are coming along well.
If you are a programmer I suggest looking into
<a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a> and <a href="evas.html">Evas</a>, or
<a href="ebits.html">Ebits</a> and <a href="edb.html">Edb</a>.  A lot of
