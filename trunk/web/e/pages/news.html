<p>
We are pleased to announce DR16.7 is now avalible for testing.  This is a major update to
DR16.  Theme transparency is now avalible and tons of bugs and leaks have been squashed.
Imlib and Fnlib requirements have now been replaced by <a href="http://enlightenment.org/pages/imlib2.html">Imlib2</a> and <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html">FreeType2</a>.  Also, the
distribution has now been split apart into 3 diffrent catagories: Programs, Themes and Online Help.
Programs would be the WM itself, themes are individually packed themes, so you no longer need to 
live with the default themes, and online help is Edox.  Why split apart the packages?  DR16.6 was a single 12M tarball, whereas DR16.7 has a 1.6MB WM tarball, 2MB Edox tarball and then all the diffrent themes.
Please test away on this release and be sure <a href="http://xcomputerman.com/bugs/login_page.php">to report any bugs you find</a>.

</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">

<p>
In the last update several important development tidbits were left out, here's some details,
and alot of catchup highlites for changes so far this year.
</p>

<p>
Ecore has had several improvements made.  Extra debugging information has been added,
Xdnd has been added, various bug fixes and leaks have been tracked down, warnings have
been cleaned up, documentation updated, and the EWD library has been integrated into Ecore.
A big pat on the back goes to RbdPngn, Raster, and especially Xcomp, among others, for all
the hard work on Ecore.
</p>

<p> 
As mentioned previously, Embryo has been added to CVS (e17/libs/embryo) and integrated
into Edje.  Edje has  also gotten doc updates, raster fixed some cross-compiling issues, 
Trill and Raster plugged some leaks, smashed alot of bugs, and more.  Also, back
in January raster added, by popular request, the ability to incorperate TTF fonts
inline with the EET, so now fonts are included in your EDC just like images are.
</p>

<p>
EVAS has gotten some bugfixes, some minor API changes, and more memory leak cleanups.
Raster also improved X86 EVAS performance by 20% in his tests!  Various cross-compiling
cleanup have been commited, and of interest to users who haven't updated EVAS in awhile, you 
no longer need to explicitly specify configuration options, most everything is now built by
default.  
</p>

<p>
RbdPngn has continued to work like mad on EWL.  There have been file dialog API changes,
bug fixes all over the place, and new features and additions everywhere you look.
</p>

<p>
You can see the major development themes here have been improving builds and stablility.
Everyones squashing bugs as quickly as they can, Trill has been on a memleak hunt with
his trusty Valgrind in hand, and raster has made improvements nearly everywhere for cross
compiling.  This is only a small overview of the changes in CVS since the start of the
year.

We are still desperately seeking developers!  <a href="http://enlightenment.org/pages/join.html">Everyone can help, find out how to get involved!</a>

Thur Apr 1 - <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - April is here... Again.
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">

<p>
Once again, April 1st, otherwise known as "Make Fun of E 1.0" day, or maybe even 
"April Fools Day" to others, is upon us.  Development has continued, but a number
of developers have been occupied with other duties slowing the overall momentum somewhat.
Despite this, some great work is going on.
</p>

<p>
The most exciting addition is that of Embryo.  Some will recall the "esmall" code in e17/apps/,
which is Rasters implementation of the <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/small.htm">Small Scripting Language</a>.
Embryo's current purpose is to extend Edje, making logic possible inside an Edje EDC itself.  
The addition of Embryo has left some poeple wondering about the future of 
<a href="http://www.ferite.org/">Ferite</a>s place inside Enlightenment.  We have never suggested that
Ferite would be the exclusive language of E, but none the less it is an extremely capable language that
will probly have close ties into the WM later on down the road, but for now we have no expectations
for it specifically.  The functionatliy that Embryo provides Edje is limited at the moment, but will
grow quickly.  Embryo is in CVS, and examples of it's use are in the sample EDC's in the Edje repository.
Documentation for the Small language itself can be found <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/small.htm">on the Small webpage</a>.
</p>

<p> 
The audio player, Eplayer, has been renamed Euphoria.  This change comes along with a major change
from a stand alone audio player to a front-end for <a href="http://xmms2.xmms.org/">XMMS-2</a> system.
Unlike XMMS (1.x) XMMS-2 has a client-server architecture, using clients that attach to the system XMMS2 daemon.
Without going into depth about the advantages of XMMS2, the Euphoria and XMMS2 are a match made in heaven; they needed an attractive front end, and we needed a robust backend.  Now we don't have to worry about adding CODEC support and they have something pretty to use as a client, showing off the EFL at the same time.  
</p>

<p>
Enlightenment DR16.7 is getting closer and closer to release.  <a href="team.html">kwo</a> has made some big and
exciting changes in DR16.7, so stay tuned.  <a href="http://www.mandrake.net">Mandrake</a> has even jumped
in and started weeding out bugs and warnings.

</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
<p>
Happy New Year from the Enlightenment Team.  As usual Nov and Dec proved busy times for
everyone as vacations came up, holidays, family, and work.  On top of that 
<a href="http://www.rasterman.com/">Raster moved to Tokyo</a>, and both 
<a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/">Pixelhead</a> and 
<a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/nova/index.html">I</a> had babies.
None the less, work has moved along.  In the last 2 months of the year we had 271 commits
into the e17 repository, including the addition of several new libs and applications.
</p>

<p>
Several developers have been added to the <a href="team.html">team page</a>, all of which
have been developing for some time now and are doing excellent work.  The honored added are
<a href="http://engy.sourceforge.net">glassy_ape</a>, 
<a href="http://andy.elcock.org">HandyAndE</a>, balony, and 
<a href="http://code-monkey.de">Trill</a>.
</p>

<p>
On the library side, most of the major libraries are stable and bugs are being found, leaks patched, and thuroughly tested.  Also, some new libs have been create to add convience and provide
extra functionality.  Among the additions are Esmart (a library of evas smart objects), Epsilon (a freedesktop.org compliant thumbnailing library), and Epeg.
</p>

<p>
The applications have been getting alot more attention in the last several weeks because they are the test bed by which we test and improve the libraries.  Xcomp's Entrance is really a thing of beauty.  And Atmos's revised Entice has changed significantly for the better.  Other apps are in the works but won't be revealed for awhile to come.
</p>

<p>
Documentation is also kicking along slowly but surely.  Our hope is to have a nice set of books to go along with the libraries when we're complete and hopefully we can meet that goal at release time.
</p>

<p>
Xcomp even pulled double duty and set up <a href="http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/e">a CIA page for us too</a>!  On that page you can track all E commits and even get updates via an RSS 2.0 feed!
</p>

<p>
So rest assured, the project is very alive and very well.  We're growing and getting closer to the end goal, with arms open to others who want to jump on board.  This should be a great year for E!

<p>
As mentioned in the last news update, large amounts of the EFL are nearly complete and from this
point on CVS updates and any API or format changes will become of interest to people beyond the development
team and testers.  And as such, we're going to be making more complete news postings of changes that
occur, summerizing CVS commits of interest and changes that will effect work that is happening outside
of the immediate project.
</p>

<p>
<a href="team.html">Kim "kwo" Woelders</a> has released Enlightenment DR16.6-pre8 to the world.
Changes since -pre7 include: fixing focus issues with dock style windows and making them sticky, 
fixing some seg faults, moving control of the FX (Ripples/Waves) to the FX Settings dialog,
and we no longer have to see the stupid FX Startup dialog ("You have enabled Ripples") every time
you start or restart E.  You can find source, SRPMs and RPMs <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">
in the files section of SourceForge Group Number 2</a>.
</p>

<p>
On the EFL front, we are happy to announce that <b>Ecore has been merged!</b> This means
that all the current lib code can be found in the main branch (HEAD), and you don't need
to fish into SPLIT anymore.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the CVS activity was as follows....  
</p>

<p>
<a href="team.html">RbdPngn</a> has been 
hard at work on EWL changing to default theme to <a href="team.html">rephorm</a>s "Winter" theme,
as well as committing a slew of updates to EWL, including the removal of some remaining Ebits in the code base,
some misc bug fixes and improvements.  RbdPngn also committed some fixes and improvements to the EWD list code, and
made EET Efence friendly.  
</p>

<p>
<a href="team.html">Raster</a> besides merging Ecore, added basic cursor support
to Ecore's X module, he may be adding XCursor support as well down the road.  Raster also made a minor
change to the Imlib2 Makefile adding libm.so to the link arguments, which has been a minor irritation on
some platforms.   He also removed some useless linking from the makefiles of e16keyedit and e16menuedit.
</p>

<p>
<a href="team.html">Rephorm</a> has released <a href="http://rephorm.com/rephorm/code/elicit/">elicit 0.7</a> newly
Edjified, and has commited Elicit into E CVS (e17/apps/elicit/).  Also, remember his Iconbar code
has been Edjified and is in E CVS as well.  He commited an Edje API change that now causes 
edje_object_file_set() to return an int value for failure or success.  Rephorm has also been hard at work
on a new library which you can find in CVS, but we'll hold out on saying too much for the time being.
</p>

<p><a href="team.html">Atmos</a> made more commits to entrance than I can summerize here. 
<a href="team.html">Azundris</a> commited to Ecore a temporary solution to a problem keeping 
servers from working with ecore_main_loop_iterate().  <a href="team.html">Gilbert</a> added
a patch by Birger Nissen to CamE that enables a single shot mode allowing execution to just
nab a shot and exit.  And finally, <a href="team.html">xcomputerman</a> made a minor commit to
entrance modifying the font paths, and commited spelling and grammerical correntions to
the page you read now.</p>

<p>
There you have it, an overview of the last 3 weeks of CVS commits.  Let no one say we're lazy.
Raster has been in Singapore on business for the last week and should be back around this week.
If you have feedback on these types of updates, please send them our way.

Thu Sep 18 - <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - The Big News Update
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
<p>
After months of restraint heres the big update as to where E is and is going.  
Enlightenment DR17, the window manager currently in e17 CVS, is dead. As was mentioned 
in the <i>State of E</i> address awhile back the current WM code needs a complete 
rewrite, and thus the current code is nothing but a test platform. There is currently no 
publicly available WM code for DR17, but the initial CVS commit will be coming in the 
next month or two.</p>
<p>
Many lessons were learned from the WM code that currently exists in CVS, namely that 
even in CVS we stretched the limits of what Ebits could do. This prompted Raster several 
months ago to scrap it and start work on Edje. Edje is essentially Ebits2 in concept, but 
is drastically different from the original Ebits implementation.  Edje uses EET instead 
of EDB which Ebits uses, and truly does what Ebits hoped to do: abstract completely an 
applications interface from its code base.  Edje theming doesn't just put a new image in 
place of the default. It actually can completely change the feel of the user interface, 
rather than just its appearance.  On top of this Edje supports animation!  This means 
that DR17 will not be just another static looking window manager, it will have smooth 
animations and effects -- from simple fades and bounces to window borders that consist 
of swirling colors.</p>
<p>
Also, at the time the <i>State of E</i> address was released, there was uncertainty about 
Etox: would it be merged into Evas or just silently die?  I'm happy to report 
<a href="team.html">RbdPngn</a> has been working hard on the library, and now it has 
solidified its place among the <b>Enlightenment Foundation Libraries</b> permanently.  
Among Etox's more interesting abilities is automatic wrapping of text, properly handling 
of newlines in text strings when displayed, and koolest of all, reacting to obstacles!</p>

<p>
In other news, on the EVAS front, EVAS now has a GL back-end! This is in addition to the
existing Software/X11 back-end, DirectFB, Plain FB and Qtopia back-ends.
</p>

<p>
Note that due to the retirement of Ebits all apps based on it are being retired as well, 
notably Etcher, Ebony and the Ebg library.  Equivalents for Edje will probably emerge in 
the future but there is no current firm commitment right now.  There are plans for an 
Etcher equivalent for Edje but we don't know what the final form of it will be and when it 
might pop up.
</p>

<p>
At this point in time Imlib2, EVAS, Edb, EET, Ecore, and Edje are effectively complete.  
Updates and new features are still being added to Ecore and Edje, but no major changes 
particularly to the API are intended.  This is good news for the many of you who have 
wanted to jump in and play with the EFL but were scared off by warnings of impending 
rewrites.   Most of the libs are documented using Doxygen at least partially.  
Documentation is now under way to ensure there are plenty of resources for an eventual 
release.  Tutorial writers and code-building example authors are encouraged.
</p>

<p>
We're happy to report significant progress toward an eventual release.   Anyone who has 
ever written a GUI application will find the EFL a real treat so please take a look.  
Expect changes to this website over the next week reflecting the new addition of Edje and 
updates to various component pages detailing the features mentioned above.

Eprog is a convenience library for EVAS.  Just as Ecore simplifies the process of interacting with X, Eprog simplifies the process of getting an EVAS.  The best description for Eprog so far was "damnit, just give me a canvas!".  Potential programmers who think EVAS is over their heads will definitely want to take a look.  Rephorm (original contributer of the Iconbar code) has also written an <a href="http://www.rephorm.com/rephorm/code/iconbar/">iconbar in Eprog</a>, which can be used with almost any window manager, so if you only want to run DR17 for the snazy iconbar, check it out while you wait for Enlightenment DR17 to mature.</p>

Wed Jan 22 - <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Merge Mania
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
<p>SPLIT has been merged.  This means that as of last week, SPLIT is effectively dead.  All checkouts should occur from the primary branch (known as HEAD).  The only current exception is Ecore.  Ecore is currently in a re-write process by raster, so if you want the "old" Ecore, HEAD is the place to go, but if you want to test or sneek a peek at the new API, grab it out of SPLIT.</p>
<p>Ecore is so far the second major rewrite to occur, EVAS being the first.  In a desire to make DR17 a perfect release, raster wants the libraries to be as complete and full featured as possible before any type of release.  Once Ecore is done, and it nearly is, Ebits will be next on the chopping block.  The current theming model will be laid away and replaced with a vastly improved system based on the concepts and experiences of Ebits.  Enlightenment, the window manager, that is currently in CVS (e) will also be laid away and completely re-written from scratch based on the experience and concepts of what we currently have.  The rewrite for E itself is a ways off, but you should be prepared for it now.</p>
<p>The best way for anyone wanting to help now is to use and explore the libraries we currently have.  Whether you are advanced or a beginner something is there for you to get your teeth into.  Please try them out, get a feel and let us know how you like them.  No major changes are anticipated for Imlib2 or EVAS moving forward and Ecore's new API is stabilizing in SPLIT .  Anyone who has ever tried to use X directly will greatly enjoy Ecore's "just give me a window damnit" approach and easy handling techniques, so please give it a try and let us know how you like it.</p>

Fri Dec 26 -  <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - A long, fruitful year
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
<p>It's been a long year for the team, but a fruitful one.  DR16.5 is still in heavy usage and will stay so for many years to come.  DR17 has seen the bulk of the back-end work done.  EVAS has picked up a following and gained some press.  While at the same time we've seen several developers leave the project as they move onto different parts of their lives.</p>


<p>As this project is constantly fighting the "is E dead?" battle, it's important to point out that this project  has always been as much, if not more so, about libraries than the window manager that we all know and love.  Imlib is still in heavy usage, Imlib2 has become a critical part of many projects.  EVAS is going to be a significant force in the future, and will be as big a hit as Imlib.  Not only that, our library collection includes a full widget library (EWL) based on EVAS, several convenience libs (Ecore, Eprog, EWD), libraries for text rendering in EVAS (Etox, Estyle), a packaging and distribution format (EET), a database (EDB), and a revolutionary themeing scheme (Ebits, Ebg).  Not to mention tools for EDB (e_gtk_ed, Ebindings, etc), and Ebits/Ebg (Ebony, Etcher).  We've got the file manager backend completed (EFSD).  We've got a widget daemon (Ewidgetd), one of the nicest image viewers ever written (Entice), and two file managers (Essence, <a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net/">Evidence</a>).  And there is more than that!  We're running out of words that start with E.  For the last 2 years the E project is closer in scale (not goal) to KDE and GNOME than any other of the desktop projects.  E will be a complete desktop shell, and we've been laying the groundwork toward that end.</p>

<p>To take a look at where we are, go to the <a href="source.html">CVS sources page</a> and check out the SPLIT branch.  In the last year, E broke CVS into two branches the so-called "stable" main branch for users (known as HEAD) and the development branch which has been very unstable (known as SPLIT).   As code becomes more stable it is planned to be merged back into HEAD, but most of this hasn't been completed yet. So far EVAS (formerly known as EVAS2) and EET have been merged back into HEAD, so keep an eye on the CVS sources page to make sure you are using the correct current code.   Before checking out the source please read <a href="cvsnotes.html">the build notes</a> and README's for each codebase since they have very specific requirements.  As usual, the E team doesn't support ANYTHING in CVS... everything is still in heavy development and subject to changes at any time.</p>

<p>And speaking of changes, EVAS programmers who haven't looked at EVAS lately should.  EVAS was reworked completely in the SPLIT branch as EVAS2 and recently merged back into HEAD.  This rework includes some major API changes.  Any coders who have used EVAS in their projects at some point should take a look and update your applications.  The EVAS2 code in SPLIT is now dead, and EVAS proper in HEAD is current.  For other updates regarding EVAS look at <a href="http://www.rasterman.com/pages/news.html">Raster's news page</a>.</p>

<p>While the window manager isn't complete yet, you can clearly see that any programmer has plenty of toys to play with.  The common joke is that when we're done the window manager will be written in 5 lines of C.  Some truly great things are coming thanks to all the hard work from Raster, Rephorm, Atmos, RbdPngn, Tillsan, Vac, and many others.</p>
<p>Happy New Year from the Enlightenment crew!</p>

Check them out and post post post. </p>

<p>In other news, as many have no doubt read, Raster was recently <a href="http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=141">interviewed</a> and the story made it to <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/20/1342205&mode=thread&tid=106">slashdot</a>.  Please, if you have not already, read <a href="http://www.rasterman.com/pages/news.html">Raster's comments on the interview</a>.  You find things greatly clarified.</p>

<p>As development goes right now, we're trucking along.  Many of the big changes are being put on hold while Raster is overhauling EVAS.  The progress of EVAS is amazing, and can only be appreciated properly when you've seen what it can truely do.  Once EVAS is completed many of the other compontants of DR17 which are based on EVAS will get worked on, building upward toward E DR17 itself over time.  </p>

Thur Mar 28 -  <a href="mailto:benr@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - DR17 kicks into high gear
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
I'm very happy to report that progress is happening rapidly and there are very
tangible results.  Long months were spent working on the libraries which formed
the foundation of DR17, and it has paid off in a very nice windowing
environment that is fairly usable.  However, because the focus has been on
developing these libraries, the Enlightenment "window manager" is still merely
a shell by which to test, and not a true taste of what will exist when it nears
completion.  Though it does look very appealing in screen shots, do not judge
it by what it is today because there is a lot more to come.

<p>Some of the real magic is happening right now on the components that will
form the file management aspects of DR17, which will be isolated from the E
package directly.  Originally these functions were to be built directly into E,
however the developers felt it would be wiser to build separate libraries to
handle these functions to allow for easier maintenance and expansion, and hence
a cleaner more distinct back end.  For people who have used DR17 and wondered
why they can't do much more than copy files between views, this is the work
that will interest you.</p>

<p>The development that I just mentioned is currently happening in a separate
branch of CVS.  The reason being that the developers realized that many people
are currently using and experimenting with DR17 from CVS, and their work is
going to break most of the modules for a while as they get the core work done,
this allows them to work without bothering users.  We should all be thankful
that they did this, so we can all continue to enjoy DR17 while they work.
There is currently, as always, no time frame as to when they will be done, and
there will naturally be some problems, but when the development gets to a point
that the developers feel it's ready, they will be integrating the code back
into the main CVS modules.  Until then it is recommended that anyone developing
based on current CVS be aware that any changes they make could be impacted by
the merge when they are done and to be prepared for any conflicts, should they
occur.</p>
