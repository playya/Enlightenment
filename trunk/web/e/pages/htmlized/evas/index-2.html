<div style="position:absolute;top:169;left:139"><nobr><span class="ft1">that at the time had no other solution. The problem was that we needed  a rendering abstraction</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:204;left:139"><nobr><span class="ft1">rather than immediate-mode level. One that would also optimise the display of such structured</span></nobr></div>
