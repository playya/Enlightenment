<div align=center><font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=4><b>Goodies (subsystems for Enlightenment)</b></font></div>
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
As a result of meeting requests from users, Enlightenment over time has done
some nasty hacks, but now for the development of version 0.17.0, we have
moved a lot of the design and core code into various subsystems than
generalize some back end and let us not only use it in Enlightenment itself,
but make this work available to everyone to use as they want. The result is
various lower level libraries that do lots of useful stuff for you and
provide a consistant api to them. Also daemons and helper programs have been
written too to make life easier.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=enlightenment.html>Enlightenment</a> is (as of 0.17.0) a window
manager and desktop shell. This means it handles managing of windows, launching
applications, managing icons and files on your desktop and in directories
with drag and drop. The management of already running applications and easy
launcher bars is also part of its job.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=evas.html>Evas</a> is a canvas abstraction that uses Imlib2, as well
as OpenGL, and X11. It serves as a canvas accelerator and abstraction and
does the job really well. It has made building E17 trivially easy - at least
the rendering parts. This should continue to make things easy, as well as 
provide a good acceleration mechanism.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=imlib2.html>Imlib2</a> is the abstraction layer that handles the
raw nasty work of loading images, saving them, rendering them to a drawable
or blending and scaling them onto other images, software anti-aliased
truetype fonts and other goodies. This one is pretty much done and finished 
with. It gets minor updates and fixes as needed, but otherwise is left alone. 
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=ecore.html>Ecore</a> is a nice convenience library. It handles
abstracting X calls so you don't have to pass as many parameters to them. It 
wraps lots of other sequences of X calls you want to do often, handles
caching local geometry of windows to save extra X traffic, abstracts X's
events and adds a timer system to be able to do timeouts, handles the core
event loops, abstracts signals into being events in the event queue, and lets
you arbitrarily add other file descriptors to the loop to listen on and have
handlers be called when they become active, and much much more. Ecore also
handles filtering events and calling idle handlers when appropriate. Ecore is
just what it says - a very complex CORE subsystem. It is all callback based,
and keeps everything abstracted - but does not move away from normal X11
primitives like other abstractions (gdk for example), thus keeping 100% 
compatability with normal Xlib stuff. The core innards of E17 rely heavily on
Ecore and its ability to not just work, but work well and optimize silently for
E17.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=ebits.html>Ebits</a> is a higher level abstraction of image groups
built ontop of Evas. Basically it's what the old E16 window border logic 
was - but on steroids. It can do a WHOLE lot more and is being used as the
basic building block for all widgets in E17. A GUI editor is also there
called Etcher - it can edit Ebits files - thus letting you have a nice GUI to 
desing your widgets, window borders etc. in. 
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=etox.html>Etox</a> is a text layout abstraction, built on top of
Evas. It is to text, what Ebits is to images. It is intended to abstract text
layout to allow different fonts, colors, styles (outline, shadowed, etc.),
word wrapping, paragraph layout, columnation and wrapping of text around
obstacles in the text area.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=edb.html>Edb</a> is a database abstraction layer to Berkley
Databases. Edb contains the source for db 2.7.7, thus freezing the database
format on disk, making sure it will never become incompatible (as is a habit
of the db interface in libc). Edb wraps this with a convenience and
optimization API layer, making database access easy, fast and consistant. It
handles typing of information in the database and much more. Edb is *VERY*
fast and all of E17 configuration management is build ontop of it -
every configuration file is a database - including Ebits files. 
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=efsd.html>Efsd</a> is the filing system abstraction layer. It is a
library and a daemon process that the library communicates with for the
calling process (in this case E17). It handles all filing system interaction
in an asynchronous manner, so E17 isn't ever left blocking on basic IO
requests. It handles copying, renaming and deleting of files. Also listing of
directories, monitoring for changes in directories, retrieving stat
information on files, as well as meta-data retrieval and modification for
files. All of this is done in an asynchronous request/event system thus
keeping E17 free to handle user interaction as much as possible while efsd
does the nasty IO work. cK is currently busy working on this. 
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=ewl.html>Ewl</a> Ewl is a widget set built ontop of these subsystems.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=ewd.html>Ewd</a> Ewd is thread safe simple data types library.
It got doubly/singly linked lists, binary tree, and a hash table
implementations.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=etcher.html>Etcher</a> Is a GUI config editor to edit Ebits files.
<p><!-- <font face="arial,helvetica,lucida" size=2> -->
<a href=elogin.html>Elogin</a> is a xdm/gdm/kdm login replacement built on
evas, ecore etc.
