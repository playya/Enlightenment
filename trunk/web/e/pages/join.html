<p class="contenttitle">Join the Project!</p>

<p>
Open Source and Free Software is about more than running software
at no cost: it's about building a community, contributing, and helping
others.  If you believe in the Enlightenment project we invite you
to join up and contribute.  Whether you are an experienced C programmer,
a talented graphic or interface designer, or just an enthusiastic user
there is a way for everyone to be a contributer.
Here are some ideas on how you can help and make Enlightenment
better for everyone...
</p>

<p class="contenttitle">Developers</p>

<p>
Whether you are an experienced C developer or have just
recently started to code (or even if you've never coded before!)
the best way to get started is by checking out CVS and examining
the code.  Each project has it's own Doxygen documentation for
reference.  We take pride in the fact that our APIs are simple and
very easy to use and learn.  In addition, you can find extended
documentation on our documentation page, or <a href="support.html">ask the 
existing developers themselves via IRC or a mailing list</a>.

</p>


<p class="contenttitle">Graphic Artists</p>

<p>
Enlightenment is known first and foremost not for it's superior
coding, sadly, but for it's eye candy.  More than any other graphical
environment, Enlightenment leads in visual appeal and is birth place of the
most emulated themes.  We are <i>always</i> looking for new artists and
interface designers.  Whether you like making logos, themes, or layouts
we can use your help.  You don't even need to know how to actually build
the themes - there are many other willing project members who enjoy
building themes but don't posses the artistic ability, or so they think,
to actually create new themes.  Submit a mock-up of what you want and
people will beat down your door to make it a reality.  
<a href="support.html">Show your ideas off via IRC of the E-Users
mailing list</a> to be instantly showered in praise.
</p>


<p class="contenttitle">I'm just a user!</p>

<p> 
Everyone has something to contribute, even if you don't feel comfortable
with coding or doing graphics.  Some of the most important roles in
the project don't involve being an expert coder or artistic genius:
they involve helping others.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in programming but don't think your very good at it, you 
can learn by writing a paper for beginners
on how to use EVAS or EWL.  A lack of experience makes you perfect for
learning from the ground up and passing that experience on to other new 
would-be programmers who will have the same struggles.  Documentation as a
new programmer also helps provide a useful crutch, providing goals along the
way that serve as self encouragement.
</p>  

<p>
If you aren't interested in programming you could write tutorials or a users manual
for any of the applications; with <a href="http://www.cafepress.com">Cafe Press</a> 
you can even offer new users a nice printed manual!
</p>

<p>
If all that seems like too much, you can always do the difficult
grass-roots work that is vital, such as testing and submitting bug reports,
evangelizing Enlightenment, or just logging into IRC or trolling the E-Users 
mailing list to help other users.  When people judge a project or product they
generally develop an opinion based on three things: firstly by it's appearance,
secondly by it's use and ease of use, and thirdly by the support.   There
are plenty of projects that are useful and nifty, but when confronted with other
users or developers in IRC or IRL you suddenly don't care how nifty it is, you just
want to run away.  Be there to help other users and encourage them.  This
not only makes everyone happier, but make them interested in helping too.
Several of our developers came on board because they stopped by the IRC channel
with a question and enjoyed the other users so much they stuck around and 
eventually started contributing.  And remember, evangelizing means more
than telling people that Project XYZ "sucks", it means guiding users toward
features and uses they hadn't even considered possible or didn't know about.
</p>

<p>
See?  Everyone, regardless of their skill level or interests can all
be involved if they just have a passion for what we're doing and
get interested in helping themselves and others.  It's what Open Source / Free Software
is all about.
