<p class="contenttitle">Evas</p>

<p>Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw
anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend, as well
as drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps, lines and
rectangles for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are too slow.</p>
<p>Evas abstracts any need to know much about what the characteristics of your
XServer's display are, what depth or what magic visuals etc, it has. The
most you need to tell Evas is how many colors (at a maximum) to use if the
display is not a turecolor display. By default it is suggested to use 216
colors (as this equates to a 6x6x6 color cube - exactly the same color cube
Netscape, Mozilla, gdkrgb etc. use so colors will be shared). If Evas can't
allocate enough colors it keeps reducing the size of the color cube until it
reaches plain black and white. This way, it can display on anything from a
black and white only terminal to 16 color VGA to 256 color and all the way
up through 15, 16, 24 and 32bit color. Here are some screen shots of a demo
Evas app to show the rendering output in different situations</p>
<p><img src=img/evas_colors.png width=128 height=128></p>

<p class="contenttitle">Colors</p>

<p>The following screen shots of a demo Evas application were taken in 8 bit
color (256 colors), with worse color situations down to monochrome
simulated, using the software rendering engine in Evas.</p>

The next pictures were taken of the same application in 8 bit color
simulating worse color depths by reducing the allocation maximum, and using the
X11 rendering engine that uses X11 primitives instead of the CPU (ie
pixmaps, lines, rectangles, masks etc.).

</p>

<p>
Evas provides a structured mode graphics API and thus provides a set of
objects as primitives to work with. As opposed to immediate mode where the 
program actually draws the data, with structured mode the program describes 
the data with primitives and lets the canvas handle the drawing. This means
the program has to describe what it wants to draw in terms of the primitives
given. Once this is done manipulating them is very easy since the canvas
holds all the state of the boject and knows what changed. Here is a list of 
them.
</p>

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_canvas.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">Images</p>
<p>
One of the most versatile and appealing objects is the image object. You
simply tell Evas where the image file is located, where to put the image
what size the object is to be and how to fill the image object with the
image data, and Evas handles the rest. This makes dealing with images in
Evas child's play. Here is a quick example of how it would work:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
object = evas_add_image_from_file(evas, "flower.png");
evas_move(evas, object, 10.0, 30.0);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
And it would look something like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href=evas_image_eg_0.html><img src=img/evas_image_eg_0_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p>
<p>
By default image objects are the size of the original image (in pixels). If
we wish to make the object larger and have the image scale up or down in
size we could do:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_resize(evas, object, 320.0, 240.0);
evas_set_image_fill(evas, object, 0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 240.0);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Now our canvas would look like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href=evas_image_eg_1.html><img src=img/evas_image_eg_1_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p>
<p>
Easy, isn't it? now let's say we want to have a 300x200 unit rectangle filled
with this image we loaded, but we want it to tile (repeat) starting the tile
at coordinate 0,0 relative to the to-left corner of the image object area,
but have the tiled image size be 20x50.
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_resize(evas, object, 300.0, 200.0);
evas_set_image_fill(evas, object, 0.0, 0.0, 20.0, 50.0);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Our result would be something like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href=evas_image_eg_2.html><img src=img/evas_image_eg_2_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p>
<p>
You may think "I can do this just as easily with normal X drawing primitives
and a little extra sugar thrown in" but Evas does a whole lot more for you.
You never need to know how to render the objects or handle re-rendering
them. Evas does this and optimise's it for you. It handles layering and
re-sizing, it optimise's everything to minimize CPU effort with a dynamic set 
of objects. It handles the work to the point where ALL you need to do is
create, destroy, show, hide, move, resize etc. objects and Evas does the
rest of the nasty work for you.
</p>
<p>
As you can see - the program has to know and do very little. There are many
powerful things you can do, like fade images in and out, re-color them so
they look tinted, have them rendered only within a certain area of the
canvas and more.
</p>

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_text.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">Text</p>
<p>
Text is a very important part of many applications. Evas of course provides
a nice simple way of getting text into the Evas you have up without much
fuss or bother AND to boot it will anti-alias it so your edges are smooth
and not jagged AND allow of the text to be semi-transparent and much more.
</p><p>
Text allows you to display information in your Evas without needing image
objects with pre-rendered text. But first you have to realize fonts are
handled a little differently. First there is a font path - this is a list of
directories where to find font files. Evas supports Truetype fonts only -
some may think this bad, but there are more Truetype fonts than any other
format out there, and many are very good quality.
</p><p>
Evas looks at the fonts in a directory by their file name, so a font you
reference in evas as "myfont", Evas will look in the directories (in the
order given) for a "myfont.ttf" file. It is case sensitive, but this system
proves to be nice and simple. Here is a simple example.
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
object = evas_add_text(evas, "notepad", 18, "Here is a line of text!");
evas_move(evas, object, 120.0, 50.0);
evas_set_color(evas, object, 0, 0, 0, 255);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This should create a text object with its top-left starting at 120.0, 50.0
in the Evas, with the notepad font at size 18, with the text "Here is a line
of text!" and in solid black (Red = 0, Green = 0, Blue = 0, Alpha = 255).
This is what it would look like:
</p><p>
<a href=evas_text_eg_0.html><img src=img/evas_text_eg_0_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
As you can see - it is really easy to create some text in an Evas canvas,
and it is just as easy to change its contents with calls such as the following
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_text(evas, object, "Some new text here");
evas_set_font(evas, object, "arial", 30);
evas_set_color(evas, object, 255, 0, 0, 255);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Just modifying the properties of an object this way directly leads to it
changing as you would expect. There are enough text query calls too to
implement almost anything you need using text objects, including text entry
boxes, word processors, HTML and text formatting engines and much much more.
</p>

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_gradient.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">Gradients</p>
<p>
Another useful primitive that can be used is the Gradient Box primitive.
Basically this is a rectangular object that is filled with a linear range of
colors at an arbitrary angle defined as part of the properties of that object.
</p><p>
Gradients are useful for when you want to fill a background or rectangle
with something other than a solid color, but do not want to go to the
expense of needing an image for it. They can be used to highlight areas with
lighting and shadow effects and many other things.
</p><p>
Creating and managing these objects, like almost everything else, is also
child's play. Take a look at this:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
object = evas_add_gradient_box(evas);
evas_move(evas, object, 150.0, 100.0);
evas_resize(evas, object, 200.0, 120.0);
gradient = evas_gradient_new();
evas_gradient_add_color(gradient, 255, 255, 255, 255, 10);
evas_gradient_add_color(gradient, 255, 255, 0,   255, 10);
evas_gradient_add_color(gradient, 255, 0,   0,   255, 10);
evas_gradient_add_color(gradient, 0,   0,   128, 255, 10);
evas_gradient_add_color(gradient, 0,   0,   128, 0,   10);
evas_set_gradient(evas, object, gradient);
evas_gradient_free(gradient);
evas_set_angle(evas, object, 290.0);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Now the program we are developing looks now something like this:
</p><p>
<a href=evas_grad_eg_0.html><img src=img/evas_grad_eg_0_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
As you see, you create the gradient box object, place it somewhere in your
Evas and set its size. Now you get to define the list of colors it is to
use (from start of the gradient to end) and their relative "distance" apart.
This is relative to the length of the gradient, not an absolute, so the
total length is the sum of all the distances (except the first element in
the gradient whose distance is ignored). We add in white, yellow, red, dark
blue then "transparent" in the gradient in order, then set this gradient to
be used by this gradient box. Once we are done setting up this gradient we
can set it to be used by more than one gradient box, and when done with it
finally, we can just free it. All we do now is determine the angle the
gradient is at in the box (with 0 degrees being the first element of the
gradient at 12:00 o'clock, going all the way up to 360 degrees in clock-wise
rotation), and then we show the object. All we need to do now is move and 
resize it, show it, change the angle etc. and Evas handles it for us.
</p><p>
This is not where it ends. There are other primitives that Evas supports.
Polygons, Lines and Rectangles complete this list for now, but future plans
at a later point may mean Video objects (eg MPEG streams as objects), curved
objects (ellipses, circles, splines etc.) and more, but for now they are not
supported.
</p>

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_primitives.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">Other Primitives</p>
<p>
At your disposal you also have Rectangles, Lines and Polygons too. You can
use these to fill in backgrounds, simulate circles (with polygons) and much
more. They are versatile and simple and let you do basic drawing without
requiring on-disk data to generate it from.
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
object = evas_add_rectangle(evas);
evas_move(evas, object, 20.0, 130.0);
evas_resize(evas, object, 50.0, 70.0);
evas_set_color(evas, object, 20.0, 50.0, 100.0, 130.0);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Here we add a simple rectangle that's blue-ish and partially transparent.
It's easy to add - no problems. It may seem a fair bit of setup code, but
now we can just move, resize, show hide etc. the object whenever we want a
change - Evas does all the rest for us - including layering, obscuring,
figuring how to re-render it and optimizing the rendering to only render
what changed and much much much more.
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre>
object = evas_add_poly(evas);
evas_add_point(evas, object, 0.0, 0.0);
evas_add_point(evas, object, 150.0, 80.0);
evas_add_point(evas, object, 210.0, 150.0);
evas_add_point(evas, object, 80.0, 110.0);
evas_add_point(evas, object, 20.0, 30.0);
evas_set_color(evas, object, 200.0, 40.0, 0.0, 130.0);
evas_move(evas, object, 20.0, 220.0);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
A polygon, reddish/orange, partially transparent with 5 points. We create the
polygon relative to the top left of its bounding box then just move it where
we want it later - this makes it easy to just move polygons around without
having to reset their coordinates. Just like with polygons - Evas handles
optimizing all the other stuff surrounding these objects for us.
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre>
object = evas_add_line(evas);
evas_set_line_xy(evas, object, 220.0, 240.0, 390.0, 380.0);
evas_set_color(evas, object, 30.0, 80.0, 80.0, 200.0);
evas_show(evas, object);
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
And a line. Anti-aliased. Simple. Just change its color and coordinates when
you want. Evas does the rest.
</p><p>
And now with these primitives added out Evas canvas will look like this:
</p><p>
<a href=evas_primitives_eg_0.html><img src=img/evas_primitives_eg_0_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
There are many other important parts of using Evas to achieve the look and 
feel you want in your application. It is important you know what else is
available so you don't do things "incorrectly" and as a result get slower
performance or bad display quality.
</p>

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_canvas.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">Tinting and Fading</p>
<p>
Doing effects in Evas is almost child's play like everything else. You can
tint and fade image objects, for example with very little effort. Let's
start a new Evas with a single image object and a textured background.
</p><p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_0.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_0_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
Now lets "tint" this object red. That's easy:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_color(evas, object, 255, 0, 0, 255);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
When you set the color of an image, every pixel of that image is multiplied
by the color value. So pseudo-code wise output.red = (pixel.red * color.red) /
255, and the same for the green, blue and alpha channels. Here is the result
of multiplication by RGB 255,0,0,255 :
</p><p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_1.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_1_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
Now let's try tinting the cube yellow:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_color(evas, object, 255, 255, 0, 255);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_2.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_2_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p>
How about blue?
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_color(evas, object, 0, 0, 255, 255);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_3.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_3_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
Let's try fading the cube half-out:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_color(evas, object, 255, 255, 255, 128);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_4.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_4_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
Let's try making the cube just plain darker than it normally is:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_color(evas, object, 128, 128, 128, 255);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_5.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_5_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
Finally let's try fading it out and tinting it dark-red:
</p>
<table><tr><td><pre>
evas_set_color(evas, object, 128, 0, 0, 128);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<a href=evas_recolor_eg_6.html><img src=img/evas_recolor_eg_6_thumb.png width=80 height=80 border=1></a>
</p><p>
As you can see, fading images out, tinting images is almost no workat all. 
In addition to being able to scale them, raise and lower them above and below
other objects, have them alpha blend and more, you have a pretty simple way
of creating complex effects within an Evas' canvas.
</p>

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_canvas.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">Clipping</p>
<p>
Now lets look at clipping in Evas. Clipping is the process by which you
"clip off" bits of what you are drawing that lie outside the area you are
clipping to. For example - you have an image and you clip it to a box that
is smaller than the image placed in the middle of the images location. This
means the image will now only be drawn in the area that clips it - ie this
rectangle. The parts of the image lying outside the bounds of this rectangle
will never be drawn. You can also think of this as windowing - allowing
only what you can see through the "window" (or clip region) to show through.
In theory you can use any object as a "window", or clip object, but due to
back-end renderer limitations, Evas only supports using rectangle objects as
clip objects for now. Using any other kind of object has undefined results. 
Clip objects can be used to impliment things such as viewports, windows and 
much more - you will need to use your imagination to really use them fully.
</p><p>
Also just like a window that may be stained a certain color, Evas can let
you "Tint" or "Stain" the objects clipped by a clip object. Just like you
set the color of an object like and Image, and it gets "tinted", the same
applies to clip objects. If the clip objects color is opaque white (255,
255, 255, 255), it does not affect the color of any object it clips - it
merely limits the drawing region, but if the clip object has any other color
its RGBA values are multiplied by the color of the objects it clips - thus
being able to tint and fade objects that are clipped all in one go.

<p class="contenttitle">The Viewport and Resizing</p>
<p>
Evas operates on the concept of a viewport. A viewport is a rectangular
region of an area that deifnes what part of that area we are looking at. In
Evas you tell Evas what the location and size of the viewport is. An  Evas
canvas is almost infinite in size (as large a value as can be fit in a
double precision number in both X and Y directions), and thus you need to
tell Evas what limited area of the "world" (or canvas) you are looking at.
This is the viewport.
</p><p>
Evas also requires you tell it the size of the window it's outputting to.
This is necessary for some of the back-end renderers, but also is useful for
being able to zoom and pan across the canvas. If you do not change the
output size of your Evas, but change the viewport size, you will effectively
zoom and and out of your Evas canvas. By changing the viewport location you
can scroll around your Evas. If the size of your window changes you MUST
tell Evas the new drawable output size before rendering again - or things will
not display correctly.

<p class="contenttitle">Handling Exposes</p>
<p>
Evas itself doe not hook to your event layer at all. It relies on you
feeding events into it. One of these, required for consistant output, is
telling evas when a section of its output has been "exposed" (you get an
expose event from X when this happens). This means that that area of the
window has been damaged and needs to be redrawn. When you get na expose
event you simply tell Evas about this event, and that's all you ever have to
do. This is the only time you should need this function call at all since
moving objects or changing things in the Evas canvas will internally trigger
areas to be marked as dirty and be redrawn anyway.

<p class="contenttitle">How Evas Renders</p>
<p>
Evas minimizes the amount to render whenever possible. As long as you don't
force it to do rendering then it doesn't have to (ie uselessly call the
evas_update_rect() call, or call evas_render() or evas_render_updates() all
the time whenever you make any changes at all to an Evas), Evas will keep
rendering to a bare minimum for you, and still retain display quality and
rendering speed. Remember to only call Evas's render calls when you program
goes IDLE - ie no more events to process and no state to change. Doing
otherwise will impact perfromance badly.

<p class="contenttitle"><img src=img/evas_canvas.png width=128 height=128></p>
<p class="contenttitle">The Rendering Engines</p>
<p>
Evas provides you with several output targets for an Evas canvas. Once a
rendering engine is set though, it cannot be changed. You can select how
Evas is to render to the display target by selecting the render method.
