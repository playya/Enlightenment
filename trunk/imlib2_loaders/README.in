Imlib2_loaders @VERSION@

Additional Image Loaders

This package contains image loader plugins for Imlib 2 that are not dis-
tributed together with the Imlib 2 package itself. More about Imlib 2
can be found on http://www.rasterman.com/imlib.html.

XCF loader:

The XCF loader cannot be packaged together with Imlib 2 because Imlib 2
is distributed under the BSD license, whereas the XCF loader is using
elements of the Gimp's (www.gimp.org) codebase, which is distributed
under the GPL. The XCF loader therefore is GPL'd as well.

2 other loaders are here too:

EDB and EET
