 * improve explosions (there is the empty image hack which is actually not a
   good idea).

 * better scenario management (putting it in edc ? an eet ? something else ?)

 * once scenario is correctly managed, a game editor ?

 * better graphics (my dream would be a xenon 2 clone). So someone with
   pixel art abilities would be welcome. If you know one...

 * manage aliens with more complex movements (sinusoidal, or following a curve
   which parametrical equation is given, for example). Also, aliens with more
   than one "image" (like a snake, for example. See Xenon 2 again...), aliens
   that have an animation when destroyed (adding that for the rock, for example)

 * fill that file !
