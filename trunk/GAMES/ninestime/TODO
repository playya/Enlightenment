improve cooldown system (it should have more cooldown time to +,
 then, -, and then * /)
when applying an operation to two numbers, the result should be put into the
list of numbers again, as a new number;

 - make the two numbers at the top with the operation start to move as the timer
   goes on;
 - show the two numbers that are being operated in the middle of the screen.


Maybe in the future
===================

 - make different points for each operation?
 - increase the points when different operations are used? Maybe a combo for this too?
 - increase the game difficult with more days, reducing the number of 0s and 1s that appear,
   maybe even increasing the digits of the generated numbers?
