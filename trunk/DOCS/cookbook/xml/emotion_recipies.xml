Emotion is a video &amp; media object library designed to interface with Evas and
Ecore to provide autonomous "video" and "audio" objects that can be moved,
resized and positioned like any normal object, but instead they can play video
and audio and can be controlled from a high-level control API allowing the
programmer to quickly piece together a multi-media system with minimal work.
Emotion provides a modular decoder layer system where a decoder module can be
plugged in separately to provide decoding resources for Emotion. Emotion
currently has 1 decoder module that uses XINE as the decoder, allowing it to
play DVD's, MPEG's, AVI's, MOV's, WMV's and much more. Its test program is
already a useful DVD player (without a lot of the fancy control interface) and
can play multiple video streams with semi-translucency and more.
