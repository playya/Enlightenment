   <H3>What is EFL?</H3>
   
      <P>These provide both a semi-traditional toolkit set in Elementary 
      as well as the object canvas (<em>Evas</em>) and powerful abstracted 
      objects (<em>Edje</em>) that you can combine, mix and match, even layer 
      on top of each other with alpha channels and events in-tact. 
      It has 3D transformations for all objects and more.</P>

   <H4>Enlightenment 17</H4>

      <P>Enlightenment 17 (<em>E17</em>) is the flagship application to the EFL
      libraries. This window manager for Linux based systems is built entirely upon
      EFL, which enables it to be graphically pleasing, as well as extremely
      lightweight and fast. </p>

   <H4>Elementary</H4>
   
      <P>Elementary is widget toolkit written with Evas, Ecore and Edje (<em>the core
      components of EFL</em>). It is extremely fast to develop with as
      there are a huge amount of widgets available, which means less
      'boilerplate' coding. Elementary is designed to be touch screen
      friendly, and can be scaled for ease of use on small screens.</P>
