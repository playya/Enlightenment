   <H3>Tests and Benchmarks</H3>
   
      <P>There are many developers working on improving EFL
      as a commercial set of libraries. To ensure that
      EFL is a leader in performance, a number of benchmarks
      are conducted to ensure each version is as fast or 
      faster than the last.</P><BR>


   <H4>Memory & Start Time</H4>

      <P>A series of tests were performed to attain who is the 
      the leader in base memory usage and boot time. The tests
      were conducted on an Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit system, with 
      GDM set to auto-login, xsplash disabled and all 
      environments customised to a user acceptable comfort
      level. This was a very important point, as a lot of 
      tests are conducted with default installs which in some
      instances are quite tedious to use.</P><BR>

      <IMG src="media/graph-time.png" alt="Time" style="padding-bottom: 50px; border-style: none;"></A>
      <P>As evidenced, E17 is on the same level of memory usage and 
      start time as the ultra slim fluxbox window manager. While fluxbox has
      a minor advantage over E17 in base memory usage, it is
      no where near as functional or visually appealing as E17.</P><BR>


   <H4>EET vs SQLite</H4>

     <P>While making a photo manager, <A href="http://watchwolf.fr/blog/index.php?post/2009/09/27/Sqlite-versus-Eet">Watchwolf</A>
     needed a backend to sort the photos into a library. 
     The application must load a list of albums and photos
     from a database, and also syncronize the database
     with new photos and deleted albums and photos. As
     a test, he went on to write a small application that
     directly compares SQLite (a minimalist SQL implimentation)
     to Eet (a tiny database library).
     </P>
     <P>The tests consist of creating a database from 1231 albums
     and 27657 photos. <em>Syncs</em> is the time taken to 
     create the database, <em>Loading</em> is the time taken 
     to load all the data to memory and <em>ReSyncs</em> is 
     the time taken to compare the database to the 
     harddrive contents.</P>
