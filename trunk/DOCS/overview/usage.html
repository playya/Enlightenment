   <H3>Usage</H3>
      
      <P>EFL depends upon a small number of things. It requires
      a POSIX system like Linux or BSD, and a number of small image 
      libraries and an X server is needed to run E17. As such, anything
      that can run linux with a display, can basically run EFL.</P><BR>

   <H4>Mobile Technology</H4>

      <P><IMG src="media/usage-mobile.png" alt="Phones" width="100px" class="floater">
      Because of its low memory footprint and responsiveness,
      EFL is a prime candidate for mobile phones and PDAs. It
      has already been ported to Nokias Maemo platform, the 
      Freerunner open phone, and will run on any linux based
      phone with an X server. There is also a framebuffer
      engine for use without an X server. EFL has recently been
      sponsored by Samsung to develop technology for their
      up and coming handset models.</P><BR>
   
   
   <H4>Set-top Box</H4>

      <P><IMG src="media/usage-games.png" alt="Games" width="100px" class="floater">
      EFL has been combined with Javascript and Mozillas Spidermonkey
      engine to create a resource friendly game and application environment.
      Elixir, the program used to bind it all together, is used on Freebox
      systems with an X server. There is also the Enna Media Center which
      has been used on Linux based set-top boxes.</P><BR>
