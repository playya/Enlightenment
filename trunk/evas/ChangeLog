          invisible

        * It's actually a merge from my local branch upstream so this
          includes many changes.
        * Fixed cursor/selection handling with BiDi text.
        * Fixed many BiDi issues in both textblock and text objects.
        * Cleaned up textblock and font engine a lot.
        * Added auto-alignment to tetxblock and text objects.
        * Added mixedwrap (word wrap, and if a word is too big cut it) support
          to textblock.
        * Renamed a lot of stuff.
        * Made textblock faster, mostly by saving item sizes and caching
          layout items when text doesn't change.
        * Added harfbuzz (ot layouting/shaping and etc) support.
        * Currently you need to set the env var EVAS_USE_OT to '1' in order to
          use OT support (harfbuzz) that will change soon.
        * More code cleanups will be coming in the future. This shipment is
          mostly to get code review started (and also make sure I don't have a
          merging hell later on).

	* Fix lurking free bug in key grabs.

	* Added WBMP loader thanks to Samsung.

2011-02-01  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Started using string objects instead of strings in most of the font engine (everywhere except draw). Haven't removed the paramteres yet, but did mark them as UNUSED. Removing them will be part of a future change.
	* Removed run-time OT toggling support, OT is now fast, no need for that.
	* Renamed all of the intl_props->text_props (because it really changed purpose
	* Fixed spliting/merging of text_props to be fast and good, not hacky and complex like before.
	* Added "mirrored mode" to table object.

        * Proxy Objects; Now you can set an image to have a 'source' of
        another object.  The proxy will display the object as well.  Proxy
        objects should be mostly complete.
        * Proxy objects should be complete; please report and bugs to me.
        * Partial support for arbitrary clipping.  Final support coming soon
        (with some other changes).  You can set most objects as a clip on
        other objects.  This will use the alpha channel of the object as a
        clip on the object.  This is still buggy.
        * Software support for arbitrary maps.  So you can use any size map
        (not just 4 points) for maps.  Once again this is a little buggy.

        * GL engine gets a speculative texture cache to shadow the
          normal image cache to avoid excess texture uploads when
          cycling images often. Should improve performance in some
          cases.

2011-02-12  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix "rediculous scaling size" bug, where scaling images to
          sizes like 1 billion pixels high or wide caused evas to try
          allocate scaletables on the stack and the stack just couldn't
          handle it. Now it only allocates a table for the visible
          region which will always be sane, and even has insanity
          checks now. At worst you'll get an unrendered image if the
          values are silly and some slowness. No crashes.
