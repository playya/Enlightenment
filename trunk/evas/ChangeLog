        * It's actually a merge from my local branch upstream so this
          includes many changes.
        * Fixed cursor/selection handling with BiDi text.
        * Fixed many BiDi issues in both textblock and text objects.
        * Cleaned up textblock and font engine a lot.
        * Added auto-alignment to tetxblock and text objects.
        * Added mixedwrap (word wrap, and if a word is too big cut it) support
          to textblock.
        * Renamed a lot of stuff.
        * Made textblock faster, mostly by saving item sizes and caching
          layout items when text doesn't change.
        * Added harfbuzz (ot layouting/shaping and etc) support.
        * Currently you need to set the env var EVAS_USE_OT to '1' in order to
          use OT support (harfbuzz) that will change soon.
        * More code cleanups will be coming in the future. This shipment is
          mostly to get code review started (and also make sure I don't have a
          merging hell later on).
