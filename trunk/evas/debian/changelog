evas (0.9.9.050+svn20090204-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Albin Tonnerre ]
  * New SVN snapshot
    - libevas-0.9.9.050a is now libevas-0.9.9.050b due to API change
    - refresh patches
    - Use new 'make doc' target to generate the documentation:
      + Add --enable-doc to configure options
      + use 'make doc'
      + build-depend on doxygen
  * Revert back to using libevas-engines and libevas-engines-extras, if the
    engines <-> evas interface breaks, it will be handled by bumping the
    SONAME for libevas

  [ Nikita V. Youshchenko ]
  * Make dependency on libeina-dev versioned.
  * Add myself to uploaders.

evas (0.9.9.050+svn20081206-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upstream SVN snapshot
    - Packages renamed due to API changes
    - Add debian/patches/{01-fix-library-soname,02-reapply-autofoo}: Use release
      instead of version-info to create the library SONAME, to prevent things
      from breaking when the ABI changes again
    - Remove the symbols file as it it's almost useless now
      + As a consequence, B-D on dpkg-dev >= 1.14.8 is no longer needed
  * debian/rules: Add --disable-image-loader-edb to configure flags as this
    image loader,though deprecated, is built by default
  * [lintian] Add ${misc:Depends} to package dependencies

  * CFLAGS += -fvisibility=hidden to avoid exporting private symbols.

    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0
    - Drop Build-Dependency on doxygen as docs are now in the upstream tarball.
    - Build-Depend on dpkg-dev >= 1.14.8 as we're using symbols support.

    been rewritten:
