.SH NAME
gozer - a commandline text renderer
.SH SYNOPSIS
gozer [options] [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gozer
is a commandline text rendering utility for creating images from abitrary
text in antialised truetype fonts using optional fontstyles, wordwrapping and
layout control.
.B gozer
uses the
.B imlib2
library to create and save images.
.B gozer
has a few options, detailed below. Specify [file] as the filename to save
the rendered text to. Options can also be specified in an
.B rc file
, allowing you to save commonly used options (such as fontpaths) for reuse.
The
.B rc file
$HOME/.gozerrc is always parsed for default settings, and other rc files can
be specified on the commandline to override these options. See
.B RC FILES
for information on syntax.

.SH RC FILES
rc file syntax is simple. The '#' character at the start of a line denotes
that the line is a comment, otherwise lines are started with the name of a
long option from the commandline (without prefixing the --), some whitespace
and the value of the option. E.g.
.br
fontpath /usr/share/truetype:/usr/local/share/truetype
.br
.B NOTE
that options in a --rc-file specified rc file
.B OVERRIDE
those from the commandline, but the $HOME/.gozerrc file is
.B always
read first for default settings.
.SH COLOUR_DEFINITIONS
You can define colours in 4 ways. Using the html style:
#RRGGBB (in which case alpha defaults to 255),
.br
#RRGGBBAA, or an alternative style:
.br
r,g,b or r,g,b,a (no spaces between commas please).
.br
eg for white text, either use #ffffff, #ffffffff, "255,255,255" or
"255,255,255,255". For red, #ff0000, #ff0000ff or "255,0,0" etc.
.SH FONTSTYLES
fontstyles can be defined in the EFM syntax (for compatibility only, these
are not as powerful), or the recommended syntax defined here.
.br
The first line contains the line:
.br
#Style
.br
The second, an optional style name,
.br
#NAME mystyle
.br
There follows a list of layers. Each is described by this rule:
.br
RED GREEN BLUE ALPHA X_OFFSET Y_OFFSET
.br
The special values or 0,0,0,0 for red, green, blue and alpha specify the
positioning of the actual text in it's selected colour.
.br
For example, the following style defines a very simple shadow for text:
.br
#Style
.br
#NAME shadow
.br
0 0 0 128 -3 -3
.br
0 0 0 0 0 0
