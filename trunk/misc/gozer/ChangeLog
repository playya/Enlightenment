	* Life! Added -x and -y for specifying text offsets. Very useful
	when using gozer to annotate an image.

	* Renamed to gozer.
	* spec file was broken, had to remove "contrib" installing line as
	there was no way it would work. Left that out for now. Think I
	fixed the manpage install problem too. Dunno.

	* ~/.gomrc is now always read first if available. This sets
	default values if you want. Then commandline options are read,
	then, if --rc-file is specified, that is read and overrides all
	previous options.

	* Created and added to CVS.
