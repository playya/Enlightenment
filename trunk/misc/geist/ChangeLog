	* Fixed text update, removed duplicate call to
	_text_create_image() and dirty the object before it is resized, so
	that if it shrinks, no pixel goop is left behind.
	* Patch from Till Adam, apparently the file selector wasn't
	getting destroyed properly.
	* File selector callback didn't check path != NULL and didn't
	check the image wasn't NULL (in case of non-images).
	* Checks for valid objects in object list callbacks.
	* Wired in the object deletion button.
	* Slight optimisation by adding a function to only dirty the
	selection of an object, for when it's selection changes only - it
	saves redrawing the whole thing.

	* Stuff by pabs last night:

	- added geist_object_get/set_type() for later calls.
	- gixed a bug in geist_text_change_text() that caused a SEGV if you
	used it (SMOOTH MOVE TOM).
	- selecting ojbects in the geist window will now update the selection
	in the object list.
	- selecting an object in the list will automatically raise it.
	- added a visibility checkbox.
	- added a text entry box.  if the object you select is a text object,
	you can adjust the text real-time.
	- you can now load images with the "add" button.

	* Fixed make install to work. But now YOU HAVE TO RUN MAKE INSTALL
	FOR GEIST TO WORK! I hope you all read that ;-)

	* Oh sod it. I made it fuzzy over the neighbouring 9 pixels. Will
	be an option in the future, but this makes it easier to select
	textboxes.

	* Okay. Partial rendering works again
	* Multiple motionnotify events in the queue are reduced to one.
	* Transparency mask for object clicking. i.e. clicking the
	see-thru part of an object won't select it. I may make this fuzzy
	over 9 pixels in the future, so you don't have to be too precise
	in your clicking...

Fri Aug  4 13:06:58 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Multiple selections (using shift-click) and dragging of multiple
	objects.

Wed Aug  2 19:18:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Object selection bounding boxes.

Wed Aug  2 18:28:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Text objects.

	* Pop objects to top of layer on drag

	* It works! Renders to the gtk window and everything :)

	* Initial import. Object hierarchy done.
