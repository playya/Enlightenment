	* Decent, Working XML check courtesy of Dave J (the powertweak
	guy), much better :-)
	* A line object type. Works well, but don't try and resize it,
	that code is just a stubb right now. I had to use a line clipping
	algorithm to do partial rendering right here, so everyone thank
	Cohen and Sutherland for "lending" me theirs ;-)
	* I can put the line clipping code into imlib2 if raster is
	interested, as a seperate function of course.

	* nolan pointed out that the _object_dirty() function dirties the
	whole rendered image size, even if the object has been resized
	smaller than the rendered size. This also effects
	click-selection. Fixed now with a obj->get_rendered_area() member
	fuction. Thanks nolan :)

Fri Aug 18 00:37:25 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Check for libxml. Test whether it is installed to
	<gnome-xml/parser.h> or <libxml/parser.h> (it's the same damn lib,
	the author just got very confused about his loyalties and changed
	between one minor version and the next :/ And NO, it does not
	depend on GNOME. You need libxml1 for geist right now. libxml2
	needs a coupla bugs fixed before I switch....

Thu Aug 17 00:12:36 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Wheeeee! Geist can load it's own file format now :-)
	* Just make some changes, do a file/save and then load it
	back. Yipee!

Wed Aug 16 20:30:52 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Update object list when changing current document.
	* Freeze clist for multiple additions...

Wed Aug 16 20:13:26 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Support multiple documents. Added "Save" menu item...

Tue Aug 15 18:38:17 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Start of some menus and a working "Save as..." entry. This is
	not how the menus will end up, but serves as a working test...

Sun Aug 13 17:41:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Saving to XML format. XML is a nice structured format for our
	needs. Run geist and check the contents of test.xml after it's
	opened up...
	* Yes. You will need libxml installed for geist to compile now...

Sat Aug 12 21:38:21 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Start of abstracted "fill" type.

Wed Aug  9 19:31:43 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Object properties are now called by the objects themselves. The
	add text button has been changed to use this code, and there is a
	new "Edit" button to bring up properties.

Wed Aug  9 00:18:47 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Changed api to use obj->layer and layer->doc, cleaned it up a
	lot in the process.

Tue Aug  8 23:19:35 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Patch from Tillsan for "add rectangle" and the start of some
	object property code.

Tue Aug  8 18:51:07 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Seperated resize modes from alignment modes. API cleanup.

Mon Aug  7 21:34:38 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Rectangle resizing
	* Centred text resizing
	* Centred image resizing, need to implement zoom and scale resize
	modes for this next.

Sun Aug  6 23:04:59 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Moved obj->visible into state mask.
	* Backend of resizing code in place. Objects aren't actually
	resized yet, but drag a selection rect and see the printfs! ;)

Sun Aug  6 19:20:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* g_malloc and libc free don't mix :-) This fixes the core dump on
	opening the file selector after deleting an object.
	* Fixed bug with object freeing itself twice :)

Sun Aug  6 02:09:48 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added rectangle objects. They look kewl ;-)
	* Fixed rendering bug not visible for images, but shown for
	rects.
	* Added rectangles to the demo :)

Sat Aug  5 21:03:34 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Colour and transparency for text.

Sat Aug  5 20:49:18 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Moved the checking of pixel transparency to a member function of
	geist_object, so that different objects can determine their
	transparency differently.

Sat Aug  5 19:15:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Copy works, and handles multiple selections too.
	* Fixed coredump when typing stuff in the text boxes ;) (My bad).
	* Fixed some other stuffs... Urm...

Sat Aug  5 16:37:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Check if object is visible when seeing if it's been clicked.
	* Check a layer is visible before checking selections on its
	objects.
	* Made the object list an extended selection mode list.
	* Wired in multiple selections into the object list.
	* The editing of name/text is disabled for multiple selections
	right now, but it's easy to wire it up to modify multiple objects
	at once.
	* Delete works for multiple objects. But there cores when you
	delete the last one. I have to fix this next.
	* I'll do copy next too.

Sat Aug  5 12:59:35 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Fixed text update, removed duplicate call to
	_text_create_image() and dirty the object before it is resized, so
	that if it shrinks, no pixel goop is left behind.
	* Patch from Till Adam, apparently the file selector wasn't
	getting destroyed properly.
	* File selector callback didn't check path != NULL and didn't
	check the image wasn't NULL (in case of non-images).
	* Checks for valid objects in object list callbacks.
	* Wired in the object deletion button.
	* Slight optimisation by adding a function to only dirty the
	selection of an object, for when it's selection changes only - it
	saves redrawing the whole thing.

Sat Aug  5 12:58:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Stuff by pabs last night:

	- added geist_object_get/set_type() for later calls.
	- gixed a bug in geist_text_change_text() that caused a SEGV if you
	used it (SMOOTH MOVE TOM).
	- selecting ojbects in the geist window will now update the selection
	in the object list.
	- selecting an object in the list will automatically raise it.
	- added a visibility checkbox.
	- added a text entry box.  if the object you select is a text object,
	you can adjust the text real-time.
	- you can now load images with the "add" button.

Sat Aug  5 01:04:41 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Fixed make install to work. But now YOU HAVE TO RUN MAKE INSTALL
	FOR GEIST TO WORK! I hope you all read that ;-)

Sat Aug  5 00:55:52 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Oh sod it. I made it fuzzy over the neighbouring 9 pixels. Will
	be an option in the future, but this makes it easier to select
	textboxes.

Sat Aug  5 00:44:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Okay. Partial rendering works again
	* Multiple motionnotify events in the queue are reduced to one.
	* Transparency mask for object clicking. i.e. clicking the
	see-thru part of an object won't select it. I may make this fuzzy
	over 9 pixels in the future, so you don't have to be too precise
	in your clicking...

Fri Aug  4 13:06:58 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Multiple selections (using shift-click) and dragging of multiple
	objects.

Wed Aug  2 19:18:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Object selection bounding boxes.

Wed Aug  2 18:28:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Text objects.

Tue Aug  1 19:42:30 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Pop objects to top of layer on drag

Mon Jul 31 16:47:36 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* It works! Renders to the gtk window and everything :)

Mon Jul 31 16:47:18 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Initial import. Object hierarchy done.
