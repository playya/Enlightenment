	* Oh sod it. I made it fuzzy over the neighbouring 9 pixels. Will
	be an option in the future, but this makes it easier to select
	textboxes.

	* Okay. Partial rendering works again
	* Multiple motionnotify events in the queue are reduced to one.
	* Transparency mask for object clicking. i.e. clicking the
	see-thru part of an object won't select it. I may make this fuzzy
	over 9 pixels in the future, so you don't have to be too precise
	in your clicking...

	* Multiple selections (using shift-click) and dragging of multiple
