Optimise rendering engine. Don't render an object area if it's covered by an
opaque object above it.

Optimise events. Don't render for *every* *damn* MotionNotify event :/ Damn
GDK :)

A GUI ;-)

Saving/loading. I'll use libXML for this as it's the perfect format for
structured/hierarchial storage, and means older app versions can ignore
stuff in the file they don't grok.

More object types. Lines, gradients etc

Background definitions

Modification layers

Right-click context menus

Decent text layout. Justification, word wrapping, margins etc.

Drag-rectangle for multiple selections, creating objects etc.

Toolbox.
