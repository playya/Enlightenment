Finally got my ChangeLog script back -- figured I need to start putting some
stuff in here.  Works pretty well right now except for some of gtk/gdk's
stupidness. I think im going to have two drawing areas now actually - one
will be a solid white (or gray) pixmap as a background, I'm thinking this
may fix my exposure problems. Off to school now...

Well, thanks to KainX calling me a pansie, I started rewriting the gui code
WITHOUTH using Glade.  This has shown me something.  Glade is overrated.  It
also fills your code with a bunch of unneeded shit and does some HORRIBLE
formatting :)  Anyway, this has cut the code down by about 500 lines, and
most of the functionality is back now.  Talked to raster, have a solution
for the alpha rendering problem -- this should also speed up image renders a
good bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Feb 8 13:04:28 CST 2000

Ok, TOTAL rewrite of the code -- decided to screw Glade -- just didn't work
the way that I wanted.... but thats ok.. anyway -- shortened the code size
down A LOT.  At least 600 lines.  Fixed bug in opening images from the
File->Open Image menu.  I now have a new bug though.... happens
occasionally, will fix soon - should be a big deal.  You still have to run
ee2 from the ee2 dir, this will be changed by snapshot 3. snapshot 3 will
also have the 'scratch pad' to render on --- this should speed up rendering
and fix some of the problems with rendering alpha'd images.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, I fixed the resizing bug when you go to File->Open Image

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Feb 9 12:05:34 CST 2000
(dphase)

Well, I'm adding it to CVS now :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Feb 9 12:23:41 CST 2000
(dphase)

added an alpha channeled image to test out the alpha rendering... still
need to add the checkerboard 'scratch pad' -- coming soon :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Feb 9 14:12:56 CST 2000
(dphase)

Ok, going to File->Save will save the current image now.  Will make Save As
work soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Feb 9 15:01:06 CST 2000
(dphase)

Ok, File->Save As works now... brings up a file selector dialog, type the
name, hit Ok.  Ok, now that I have that out of the way i can work on the
chekerboard stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Took the grotesque looking menubar off of the top of the window... now you
can right click on the image and a menu should come up :)  sounds good I hope.
i have an issue where the window will not be resized properly... open an
image then open a smaller image.... window stays the same... i think i know
what is going on here, but im kinda tired... (sleep is calling).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Feb 10 12:33:42 CST 2000
(dphase)

Removed some uneeded stuff from the function prototypes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Feb 10 15:04:03 CST 2000
(dphase)

Finally have some of the checkerboard drawing code in there..... pretty much
the same way imlib2_view and feh are doing it....  you dont actually see it
yet though...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 11 17:51:24 CST 2000
(dphase)

Woooooo.... EE2 was giving me illegal instructions last night... scary...
turned out to be one of my CFLAGS....  anyway, the window resize should work
now...  before if you opened an image and then opened an image smaller than
the current image the window would not resize -- now it does.  its the
weekend now so expect the following things to be complete by sunday:

checkerboard background
image browser
ability to accept wildcards

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 11 18:19:03 CST 2000
(dphase)

sometimes you should compile before commiting.... typos and other screw ups
now fixed...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 11 18:52:55 CST 2000
(dphase)

FINALLY!
Ok, ee2 is rendering a checkerboard behind the image now :)
still have a few issues with the checks and exposure events and some
resizing problems.... but that isnt really a major issue -- and its fairly
easy to fix.  off to work on that now :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 11 23:43:49 CST 2000
(dphase)

Added some stuff to the main menu

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Feb 13 22:28:27 CST 2000
(dphase)

Damn. Didnt get as much accomplished this weekend as i wanted.... right now
the image browser is *almost* ready..  im commiting a big chunk of stuff,
but i have a seperate tree here im working on that i dont wont to commit at
the moment since it will break, well, everything (for the time being).  i
should get this up tomorrow - hopefully, but im going to quit setting dates
-- it never works :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Feb 17 13:31:54 EST 2000

Added preliminary autoconf & autmake stuff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 18 13:47:56 CST 2000
(dphase)

now accepting wildcards.. (ie, ./ee2 /var/pr0n/*.jpg) and it will show up in
the browsing window, if you dont do a wildcard, the window will not display...

now i need to hook in some callbacks to load the images in the browsing
window... note that this was a small 5 minute hack...  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*WARNING* *WARNING*
Do NOT compile this code!!!
I'm trying to fix ee2's rendering code and as of now it is broken.

(and on a lighter note we have new ee2 logo's)  ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

woooo, all the imageops are back and running using the new drawing code :)
/me high fives KainX

Additions to Makefile.am for "make install" support. I couldn't get configure's
substitution mechanism to work (substituting @datadir@ gives me
"${prefix}/share" in the code) so I'm doing the substitution in the Makefile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 25 13:16:43 PST 2000
(KainX)

Did a complete overhaul on the code.  Functionality hasn't changed, but the
code is much more organized and streamlined.  There will be interface changes
to come.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recovering from Friday night, Some fixes in the menu, work on Image Browser GUI

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

working on the gui for the image browser... doesnt do a whole lot atm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Feb 29 07:19:28 CST 2000
(dphase)

selecting an image in the browser now works... browser has some
functionality and some updates to the interface

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(dphase)

ok, wooo, i've add file.[ch] for some file stuff that i am putting into the
image browser -- the image info box on the image browser is almost done --
all i have left is the Has Alpha field and the thumbnail... ill stick that
has alpha thing in there ina  second, the thumbnailing will be a bit harder
to do

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar 1 13:34:35 CST 2000
(dphase)

Ok, the image info box tells you if the image has alpha or not

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar  1 14:11:38 PST 2000

Fixed the math lib problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Mar  2 22:24:59 PST 2000
(KainX)

No need to use two variables when one will do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hrmmmmmmmmmmmm.... first commit in a couple of days... main thing is that I
am sticking this in so i can do some hacking at work....

Ok, load up a square image and go to image->sphere map -- it will map the
image into a sphere.... very cool.  working on some caching stuff and the
way ee will create its directories... everything will be in your home dir
under .ee2/cache, i think that this is fair enough.  it was either that or
do .ee2 directories all over the place, which i dont have a problem with,
but i would have gotten a lot of shit about it...

many thanks to Nolan Goodnight for the texture mapping code, he's also
working on some more stuff for it which will be full of goody good goodness.
now, it back to work...  should have the keybindings for the main window
done today... later for now...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wheeeeeeeeee! we have the thumbnail window in the image browser working now!
scales the thumbnail to whatever size the area2 widget is, usually going to
be around 150 pixels or so.... pretty cool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Mar 10 15:23:45 CST 2000
(dphase)

Added Nolan's sphre mapping patch to clear the window then create the
sphere, also edited the sphere-map-test image a bit...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Mar 12 20:31:44 CST 2000

Alright, you can hide the main window while browsing images now... did some
work on the placement of the widgets, user shouldnt notice anything...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Mar 13 16:42:57 CST 2000
(dphase)

Ok, i think i've fixed all of the _major_ glitches i was having with the
thumbnail rendering stuff

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar 15 15:36:56 CST 2000
(dphase)

wow, the indentions and formatting in *.[ch] was _terrible_.  this should
all be fixed now. yippie.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why eat gobs of memory when you need to?  Now we can render an image with no
alpha channel and it will not render a checkerboard pixmap, its a waste of
resources to render an image that isnt really being used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Mar 19 20:24:08 CST 2000
(dphase)

TONS of new stuff.  You'll notice that we no longer have menus when you
right click on the main window.  Now a cool looking controlling window pops
up that will manage all of the stuff in one organized place.  I have hacked
browser.c to pack the image browser into the controlling window now -- it
works _very_ well it looks great.  if anyone has any suggestions, let me
know, I like hearing from you.
