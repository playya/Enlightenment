Finally got my ChangeLog script back -- figured I need to start putting some
stuff in here.  Works pretty well right now except for some of gtk/gdk's
stupidness. I think im going to have two drawing areas now actually - one
will be a solid white (or gray) pixmap as a background, I'm thinking this
may fix my exposure problems. Off to school now...

Well, thanks to KainX calling me a pansie, I started rewriting the gui code
WITHOUTH using Glade.  This has shown me something.  Glade is overrated.  It
also fills your code with a bunch of unneeded shit and does some HORRIBLE
formatting :)  Anyway, this has cut the code down by about 500 lines, and
most of the functionality is back now.  Talked to raster, have a solution
for the alpha rendering problem -- this should also speed up image renders a
good bit.

Ok, TOTAL rewrite of the code -- decided to screw Glade -- just didn't work
the way that I wanted.... but thats ok.. anyway -- shortened the code size
down A LOT.  At least 600 lines.  Fixed bug in opening images from the
File->Open Image menu.  I now have a new bug though.... happens
occasionally, will fix soon - should be a big deal.  You still have to run
ee2 from the ee2 dir, this will be changed by snapshot 3. snapshot 3 will
also have the 'scratch pad' to render on --- this should speed up rendering
and fix some of the problems with rendering alpha'd images.

added an alpha channeled image to test out the alpha rendering... still
need to add the checkerboard 'scratch pad' -- coming soon :)

Ok, going to File->Save will save the current image now.  Will make Save As
work soon.

Ok, File->Save As works now... brings up a file selector dialog, type the
name, hit Ok.  Ok, now that I have that out of the way i can work on the
chekerboard stuff.

Took the grotesque looking menubar off of the top of the window... now you
can right click on the image and a menu should come up :)  sounds good I hope.
i have an issue where the window will not be resized properly... open an
image then open a smaller image.... window stays the same... i think i know
what is going on here, but im kinda tired... (sleep is calling).

Finally have some of the checkerboard drawing code in there..... pretty much
the same way imlib2_view and feh are doing it....  you dont actually see it
yet though...

Woooooo.... EE2 was giving me illegal instructions last night... scary...
turned out to be one of my CFLAGS....  anyway, the window resize should work
now...  before if you opened an image and then opened an image smaller than
the current image the window would not resize -- now it does.  its the
weekend now so expect the following things to be complete by sunday:

checkerboard background
image browser
ability to accept wildcards

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sometimes you should compile before commiting.... typos and other screw ups
now fixed...
