ABOUT
-------

ePlayer is an audio player which is based on Ecore, Evas and Edje.
Audio decoding and output is done by plugins.
At the moment, there's an Ogg Vorbis input plugin and there are output
plugins for OSS, ALSA and Solaris.


FAQ
-------

Q: Why another damned audio player?
A: -> The purpose of ePlayer has always been to be used as a vehicle
by which to better learn the EFL components.

An audio player was chosen because it's interesting, the OggVorbis
API is very simple and can easily drawn on Ecore's strengths
(ie: idlers and timers) and provides a number of interesting interface
possibilities.

Q: Will this player ever support MP3 or my other favorite codec?
A: -> Probably not.  I don't like the SDL and other MP3 decoder
libraries aren't really appealing.  Xiph is prime for me because their
APIs are very similar to rasters, making them easier for me to deal with.

The player is being built as modularly as I can with hopes to add
more functionality in as much abstraction as possible.  At the moment I'm
really only hoping to add Xiph codes, namely SPEEX and FLAC.  RIFF WAV
support will come shortly too.... but as for MP3, I'm not rushing it.
Personally I don't use MP3 anyway, so I have little reason to care.

Q: Version 0.7!?! Where did all the other versions go!?!
A: -> Since I'm a relatively inexperienced programmer, I started slowly.

0.1 was a simple command line editor using while loops.
0.2 was rebuilt to use Ecore, but still from a CLI.

In needs of an interface that could update the time dynamically without
printing a line for each update, I moved to ncurses for version 0.3
and 0.4.

Version 0.5 was rebuilt with a graphical interface in EVAS.
Version 0.6 was a major improvement on the EVAS interface.

And 0.7 is the current rebuilt to abstract the interface from EVAS by
using Edje.

Q: Will you support WinAmp skins?
A: -> Nope.... go use XMMS if you want traditional skins.
Refer to the first question.

But I will admit that I have considered the possiblity of automating
the conversion of WinAmpv3 skins (.wal's) to Edje.
It doesn't look hard, and Edje can do everything and more that WinAmp
can do with it's interface, but in a far more general way.

The problem is really just parsing all that XML (the WA skin config
files are now XML).  With PERL there could probly be an easy conversion,
but if there is one thing I hate parsing it's XML.

It would instantly make this audio player the player to use though!
