-------------------------------------

SYNTAX: eplayer /path/to/music/playlist.m3u

eVorbisPlayer is an OggVorbis audio player which requires the Xiph Ogg Suite of libraries
found here:
http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/

It relies on libvorbis, libvorbisfile, libao, and libogg.  Further, it uses Ecore(2) and EVAS
for the interface.

FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why another damned audio player?
A: -> The purpose of eVorbisPlayer has always been to be used as a vehicle by which to better
learn the EFL componants.  And audio player was choosen because it's interesting, the OggVorbis
API is very simple and can easily drawn on Ecore's strengths (ie: idlers and timers) and provides
a number of interesting interface possibilities.  The intension has never been, and probly
never will be, to build a robust, functional and flexable audio player.  

Q: Will this player ever support MP3 or my other favorite codec?
A: -> Probly not.  I don't like the SDL and other MP3 decoder libraries
aren't really appealing.  Xiph is prime for me because their APIs are
very similar to rasters, making them easier for me to deal with.
The player is being built as modularly as I can with hopes to add
more functionality in as much abstraction as possible.  At the moment I'm
really only hoping to add Xiph codes, namely SPEEX and FLAC.  RIFF WAV
support will come shortly too.... but as for MP3, I'm not rushing it.
Personally I don't use MP3 anyway, so I have little reason to care.

Q: Version 0.7!?! Where did all the other versions go!?!
A: -> Since I'm a relatively inexperienced programmer, I started slowly.  0.1 was a simple
command line editor using while loops.  0.2 was rebuilt to use Ecore, but still from a CLI.
In needs of an interface that could update the time dynamically without printing a line for
each update, I moved to ncurses for version 0.3 and 0.4.  Version 0.5 was rebuilt with a 
graphical interface in EVAS.  Version 0.6 was a major improvement on the EVAS interface.
And 0.7 is the current rebuilt to abstract the interface from EVAS by using Edje.

Q: Where is the play list?  Where is the volume control?
A: -> Not there yet.  I was hoping to wait for a file dialog in EWL to be built, but that
looks like a good ways off, so I may have to figure it out myself.  As for play lists, I haven't
found a really solid way of building an interface to the play list.  Currently there is
basic play list support, in that you can glob files on the command line and then go forward or
back in that list, but I haven't gotten  around to the interface to it.  And volume control, I 
just haven't found a good way to handle that yet.  It's coming.

Q: Will you support WinAmp skins?
A: -> Nope.... go use XMMS if you want traditional skins.  Refer to the first question.
But I will admit that I have considered the possiblity of automating the conversion of WinAmpv3
skins (.wal's) to Edje.  It doesn't look hard, and Edje can do everything and more that WinAmp
can do with it's interface, but in a far more general way.  The problem is really just parsing
all that XML (the WA skin config files are now XML).  With PERL there could probly be an easy 
conversion but if there is one thing I hate parsing it's XML.  It would instantly make this audio
player the player to use though!
