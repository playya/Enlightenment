FAQ
-------

Q: Why another damned audio player?
A: -> The purpose of ePlayer has always been to be used as a vehicle
by which to better learn the EFL components.

An audio player was chosen because it's interesting, the OggVorbis
API is very simple and can easily drawn on Ecore's strengths
(ie: idlers and timers) and provides a number of interesting interface
possibilities.

Q: Will you support WinAmp skins?
A: -> Nope.... go use XMMS if you want traditional skins.
Refer to the first question.

But I will admit that I have considered the possiblity of automating
the conversion of WinAmpv3 skins (.wal's) to Edje.
It doesn't look hard, and Edje can do everything and more that WinAmp
can do with it's interface, but in a far more general way.

The problem is really just parsing all that XML (the WA skin config
files are now XML).  With PERL there could probly be an easy conversion,
but if there is one thing I hate parsing it's XML.

It would instantly make this audio player the player to use though!
