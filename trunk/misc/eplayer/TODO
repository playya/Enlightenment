TO DO for version 0.7:

 IMMEDIATE ISSUES :::

X> Previous File callback doesn't work.
X> Pause Segv's
-> Play list bounds checking.  Player freaks out if you go beyond the 
	begining of the list, or past the last.
X> Play button does jack shit (because of pause)
-> You can't hold down seek to keep seeking, you must click it repeatedly
	-> Same applies to volume controls
-> Interface will not update if cursor isn't over.
	-> Explicit render fixes, but not prefered.
X> Time isn't updating every second as it should.
	-> Fixed with explicit render.
-> Outter edge of interface should move the player
X> Prevous file callback segv.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

 LONG TERM ISSUES :::

X> Add volume control	***
-> Add play list window/dialog
-> Add file dialog for adding files 
-> Add support for playing play list files (*.pls)
