        * src/vorbis.c: track_open() initializes the "time_text"
          part, too
        * src/callbacks.c: when cb_track_next() is called after the
          last playlist item, it moves to the beginning again, without
          starting playback.
        * src/callbacks.c: cb_track_prev() does nothing when it's
          called on the beginning of the playlist

          calling ao_close() in track_close()
