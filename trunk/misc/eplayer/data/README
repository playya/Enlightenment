######## EPLAYER EDJE GUIDE #########

An ePlayer theme consists of several Edjes:
 * The main Edje, called "eplayer"
 * Two Edjes for the playlist entries:
   "playlist_item_title" is used for the title,
   "playlist_item_length" is used for the title's length.

The "eplayer" Edje emits the following signals:

	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY_PREVIOUS" "previous_button";
	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY_NEXT" "next_button";

	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PAUSE" "pause_button";
	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY" "play_button";

	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_FORWARD" "seekforward_button";
	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_BACK" "seekback_button";

	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "TOGGLE_TIME_DISPLAY_MODE" "time_text";
	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "TOGGLE_REPEAT_MODE" "repeat_mode";

It provides the following parts for text display:

	Part: "title"            -> Window Title
	Part: "artist_name"      -> Name of artist
	Part: "album_name"       -> Name of album
	Part: "song_name"        -> Name of song
	Part: "time_text"        -> Current pos in track ([-]00:00)
	Part: "vol_display_text" -> Current Volume Level (0 - 100)


The "playlist_item_title" and "playlist_item_length" Edjes both contain
a "text" part, which holds the actual values.

The "text" parts emit the following signals:

	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_SCROLL_UP" "text";
	action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_SCROLL_DOWN" "text";

ChangeLog:

7/28/03: Edje2 Intreface started drawing on the inferface
		of Native Instruments "Traktor DJ Studio"
7/29/03: Interface cleaned up emensly 
7/30/03: Added this README and abstracted signals



To Do:
	-> New controls need to be added (vol control?)
	-> Clipping layer for LCD doesn't work, hides 
		text when used (clip_to, )
	-> Layout methods for Buttons could be better ?
	-> LCD could contain more information and have 
		some seperation
	-> Buttons are currently 2 stage, should be 3-4
	-> Play/Pause buttons should stay down to illistrate
		that you are currently playing.

	-> Play/Pause button should blink when waiting......
