ChangeLog:

7/28/03: Edje2 Intreface started drawing on the inferface
		of Native Instruments "Traktor DJ Studio"
7/29/03: Interface cleaned up emensly 
7/30/03: Added this README and abstracted signals



To Do:
	-> New controls need to be added (vol control?)
	-> Clipping layer for LCD doesn't work, hides 
		text when used (clip_to, )
	-> Layout methods for Buttons could be better ?
	-> LCD could contain more information and have 
		some seperation
	-> Buttons are currently 2 stage, should be 3-4
	-> Play/Pause buttons should stay down to illistrate
		that you are currently playing.

	-> Play/Pause button should blink when waiting......
