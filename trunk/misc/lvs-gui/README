lvs-gui 
Copyright (C) 1999 Carsten Haitzler and Simon Horman

The lvs-gui enables the configuration of servers running
the Linux Virtual Server (http://linuxvirtualserver.org/)
kernel patches.

The lvs-gui is run on a client with an X display with ssh access
to both the Linux Directors and the back end-servers that they
load balance. The gui writes configuration files to configure
both ipvs, using ipvsadm on Linux Directors and transparent
proxying on back end servers using ipchains.

On clients that run the lvs-gui only the lvs-gui programme needs
to be installed. If using the RPM distribution this is equivalent
to installing the lvs-gui RPM.

On servers that have the Linux Virtual Server patch applied and
are to be configured as a Linux Director, the init script
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipvs needs to be installed.  This is equivalent
to installing the lvs-gui-lvs-server RPM.

On servers that run as back end servers, behind a Linux Director,
the init script /etc/rc.d/init.d/transparent_proxy needs to be
installed. This is equivalent to installing the
lvs-gui-back-end-server RPM. 

Note: Back end servers need to be configured with IP forwarding
turned on and need to have IP firewalling compiled into the
kernel.

The client that runs the lvs-gui needs to have ssh access, with
either an RSA key with a null pass phrase, or key management
using ssh-agent and ssh-add to access both the servers that are
Linux Directors and the back end servers.

The GUI will configure the Linux Director to use direct
routing, and as transparent proxying is set up on the
back end servers, the Linux Director and back end servers
can be on the same network both physically and logically.
