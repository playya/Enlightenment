Ewler 0.1
--------------------------------

Ewler is a ui editor and generator written with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (http://www.enlightenment.org).  It depends on a large number of libraries that are only available in CVS at the moment, see http://enlightenment.org/pages/cvsnotes.html for installation instructions.

To install:

./configure
make
make install

to run, just type: ewler

Ewler is also comprised of ewl_uic, a user interface compiler, which generates C code from the xml output of the ewler ui editor.

Feel free to mail werkt@users.sourceforge.net with any questions, suggestions or just to say hi.
