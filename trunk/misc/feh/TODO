Things I need to do to this thang ::)

Feel free to add stuff to it. I am very happy to delete any lines other
people add =P

o General

Rework zoom code to be more flexible/sane :-)
Scrollbars? Dunno.
The check-drawing thing KainX was talking about ages ago to speed things
up (uses X to tile a small tileset instead of imlib2). Ask KainX how best
to do this.
Switch over to popt for option handling. This'll let me process
strings and do multiple parse runs etc without the current hacks I use. I'll
have to include a version of popt for lib-challenged folk. (worth it?)
