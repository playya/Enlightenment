Feel free to add stuff to it. I am very happy to delete any lines other
people add =P


Menus need to be navigable with the keyboard.
Will have to change grabbing behaviour for this to work nicely.

Option --autograb for feh to grab keyboard - so you can control feh without
having to focus it. Have to be a bit careful with this but could be useful.
