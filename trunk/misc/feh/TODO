Things I need to do to this thang ::)

Feel free to add stuff to it. I am very happy to delete any lines other
people add =P

o List mode

I need format specifiers so people can do:
feh -L "<img src=\"%f\" alt=\"%n\" width=\"%w\" height=\"%h\" border=\"0\">"
to add images to their web pages (for example) :-)

o General

Rework zoom code to be more flexible/sane :-)
Scrollbars? Dunno.
The check-drawing thing KainX was talking about ages ago to speed things
up (uses X to tile a small tileset instead of imlib2). Ask KainX how best
to do this.
