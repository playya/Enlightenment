Fri Mar 24 19:22:51 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Muhahaha. Config file. It had to be done, there are so many
	options now. This is totally optional of course, if you don't
	create one, you'll never notice the difference. Here's how it
	works...
	* If ~/.fehrc exists, or if not, but /etc/fehrc exists, feh will
	look in it for name/options pairs. An example entry would be:
	imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30
	* You can use the theme in two ways. Either 
	feh -C themename [images]
	or you can create a symbolic link to feh with the name of the
	options you want it to use. So from the example above:
	ln -s `which feh` ~/bin/imagemap
	Now I just run 'imagemap' to use those options.
	A cooler example is
	mkindex -iO index.jpg --title-font 20thcent/24 .
        Notice the '.' at the end.
	Now with a symlink I can create a mkindex command which will
	create an index.jpg in the current directory. I just run:
	$ mkindex.
	* An example.fehrc is provided with a couple of cool examples.
	
Fri Mar 24 19:17:27 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Slightly increased the default index mode font size.

Fri Mar 24 16:59:28 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Modified index mode to only show the image name below each
	thumbnail, and added -I, --fullindex mode to provide the other
	info (size, dimensions). Squashed a bug where the index print was
	always made 30 pixels too tall ;)

Thu Mar 23 22:45:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Feh will now read options from the environment variable
	FEH_OPTIONS if it is set. These options will be loaded before
	commandline ones, and so can be overidden. The syntax is the same
	as the commandline, so multiples are allowed (eg "-Vq -Sname")
	I would recommend export FEH_OPTIONS="-Vq" as being quite handy.

Wed Mar 22 22:52:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Well, it might be an idea to tell wget to ignore server-cached
	data when reloading webcams :)
	DOH!

Wed Mar 22 19:57:04 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Better man page. Examples of cool usage.

Wed Mar 22 18:17:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Man page! Whee!

Wed Mar 22 04:14:12 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added format specifiers for actions. %w width, %h height, %p
	pixels, %s size, %t type (jpeg etc).

Wed Mar 22 03:50:24 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* User definable actions for slideshow and multiwindow modes. Use
	-X or --action STRING to define an action. The action will be run
	when the ENTER key is pressed. The action should be in the form of
	a shell command, using %f to represent the image filename
	(including path), and %n to refer to it's name. Example:
	feh -X "mv %f ~/images/%n"
	Use this to go through some images and pick out the good ones :)
	More format specifiers will follow...

Wed Mar 22 02:55:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Okay. I found a naughty bug of mine. If the last image of a
	montage/index was not loadable - core was dumped. Nice bug. Fun to
	find =) I blame redhat.

Tue Mar 21 15:45:02 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Major cruft removal and tidying of code path. Progressive
	loading code slightly less complex now.

Tue Mar 21 15:18:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Big optimisation for progressive loading in fullscreen mode. I
	was recreating the pixmap at every iteration - damnit ;)

Mon Mar 20 21:54:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Dammit. Why do I find these things *after* a release?

Mon Mar 20 19:24:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Released 0.7.0

Sun Mar 19 20:55:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Main event loop tidy up.

Sat Mar 18 21:59:55 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added a coupla more tests...

Sat Mar 18 21:56:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Fixed stupid segfault using --list when there are no loadable
	images.

Sat Mar 18 14:06:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* --list tidy up.

Sat Mar 18 02:56:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* More --verbose twiddles.

Sat Mar 18 02:18:39 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Made the --verbose output more useful, and prettier ;)

Sat Mar 18 00:37:17 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Made the -V, --verbose option give cooler output on loading
	mulitple images. It's pretty flim now.

Sat Mar 18 00:32:42 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added -U, --loadables, and -u, --unloadables. They don't show
	images, just list all the files from the filelist that are
	loadable or unloadable, respectively.

Fri Mar 17 22:58:14 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Don't need to create checkerboard for list mode, montage mode,
	index mode, etc...

Fri Mar 17 22:43:27 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* We don't need to allocate space for the file info unless we
	intend to use it. Saves RAM on big file lists...

Fri Mar 17 22:18:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Big changes. I am tired ;)
	* You can now sort the filelist in any mode.
	* Sorting by name/filename is *fast*
	* Sorting by image properties such as width, height, type etc
	incurs a delay at startup while the images are preloaded. This
	could get big for large lists of files.
	* Added a -p, --preload option to force preloading before running
	a slideshow. This weeds out images that imlib2 can't load so that
	the initial number of slides is accurate. Normally, the bad/non
	images are weeded out as you go, causing the number of slides to
	update as things go. Preload is great for montage and index modes,
	as it ensures the correctly sized space is allocated for the
	images/thumbnails/whatever.

Fri Mar 17 19:22:18 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* List modes can now sort by image info using -S, --sort. Allowed
	sort modes are width, height, pixels, size, format, name,
	filename. Default sort mode is none (ie order specified/read).
	* eg. feh -lSpixels * to see the highest resolution images...

Fri Mar 17 18:04:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added -L, --longlist to allow for more detailed listings. Lists
	are sorted by filename now too. (Until I write more sorting
	options...)

Thu Mar 16 19:47:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Slightly cleaner --list stuff...

Thu Mar 16 17:46:39 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added -l, --list mode. Doesn't display images, just analyses
	them a little and spits out an 'ls' style listing with some basic
	info. Useful in scripts. I intend to extend this somewhat soon.

Thu Mar 16 16:40:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added -q, --quiet option. Stops non-fatal image load errors
	being reported. Useful when you want to do feh * on a directory
	with some images, some other stuff. You'll only see what imlib2
	can load.

Wed Mar 15 21:32:48 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Fixed bug using the short versions of --limit-width and
	--limit-height

Wed Mar 15 21:17:26 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Better still. Font size increases in fullscreen mode, but -d
	works in windowed modes too now.

Wed Mar 15 20:58:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Hrm. Much better.

Wed Mar 15 20:36:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added -d, --draw_filename for use with fullscreen mode. It
	sticks the filename up in the top left. Needs some more work yet.

Sat Mar 11 23:35:20 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Added proper commandline option parsing courtesy of getopt_long
	:) Obviously not everyone has this, so I include it myself. Now
	you can combine args in nice ways: "feh -kR20 http://some.webcam"
	* It passes "make test" okay, but I reserve the right to have
	broken something =) Let me know?

Sat Mar 11 01:34:36 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* 0.6.4 released

Tue Mar  7 23:07:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Fixed evil segv due to uninitialised gc.

Sat Mar  4 16:33:29 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* --help output for the new options.
	* Added --booth, with is a shortcut for a fullscreen slideshow
	with an auto-change every 20 seconds...

Sat Mar  4 15:59:44 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Bah. Disabled zooming in fullscreen mode for now. I'll do the
	math and fix it later.
	* I think I'm gonna have to rewrite shedloads of it to support
	window resizing etc...

Sat Mar  4 14:46:42 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@btinternet.com>

	* Fixed progressive loading in fullscreen mode. Those callbacks
	*are* on crack, but for them to make sense would be a big rewrite
	I don't have time for now =)
	* Unfortunately, zooming in fullscreen mode is broken, I'm looking
	at this now. Also, I get a weird segv when I do "feh -F directory"
	but not when I do "feh -F file" or "feh -F file1 file2", and not
	when I do "feh directory" or "feh -b directory" etc. I'm trying to
	work this out, but the fullscreen thing should be independent of
	the filelist thing...

Fri Mar  3 22:44:25 PST 2000  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	* Added two new options.  --randomize will take the file list and
	rearrange it into a random order.  --full-screen or -F will create
	a screen-sized borderless window (akin to a screensaver) and will
	center the image within it.  NOTE:  At this point, full screen mode
	only works if you disable the progressive callback.  I'm waaaay too
	tired right now to try to make sense out of gilbertt's callback
	logic. :-)  I'll try to fix it this weekend if he doesn't beat me
	to it.
	
Wed Mar  1 15:13:04 PST 2000  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	* Math lib
	
Sun Feb 20 15:22:00 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Remove some crufty duplication.

Sat Feb 19 17:11:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Reduced mem usage, tuned file handling. Tidied up.

Sat Feb 19 00:55:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added -b, --borderless option. Can you guess what it does?

Fri Feb 18 23:51:14 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Well, if I wasn't so dumb, I'd have realised that my last
	comment only holds true for depths > 4000 or so. I don't have that
	here. So, s/massive/fscking enormous/g.
	* Fixed the *actual* problem, which was, of course, that I forgot
	to close my damn dirents.
	* Pull out the cl00bats, for I have goofed.

Fri Feb 18 23:33:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay, okay. I suck. There is a mild problem I have to fix when
	running recursively on *massive* hierarchy's. Basically, I run out
	of file descriptors :( At least it now aborts when this happens, but
	I need to fix this.

Fri Feb 18 21:13:32 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* configure.in: less stupid

Fri Feb 18 20:51:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* index.c: misc tidyups

Fri Feb 18 20:41:02 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Misc fixes and cleanups.

Fri Feb 18 16:34:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Stupid, stupid, stupid. I am stupid.

Thu Feb 17 23:14:09 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Ooh. Cool. Now slideshow/deletion numbering works more sanely -
	thanks to the new filelist code.

Thu Feb 17 23:13:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hehe. That was more dumb than usual. Deleting files somewhat
	destroyed the list, and caused nice segfaults.

Thu Feb 17 22:05:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More file-list fixes.

Thu Feb 17 21:55:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Note to self: if you prepend everything to a list, the resultant
	list will be in reverse. You'll be needing to fix that =)

Thu Feb 17 21:35:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Thank goodness for that :) I totally reworked the file handling
	code, and things are cleaner internally now. The change shouldn't
	show to a user, but for me, things are better.
	* I broke stuff badly with this change, and only now have I got
	everything back on track. There may be issues still, but it seems
	good now, and I'll keep playing with it...

Wed Feb  9 21:59:09 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Removed all the image modification code from feh, seeing as
	dphase is working on ee2. No point duplicating everything :)
	* I figure feh can view pr0n, while ee2 modifies it :) Something
	like that, anyway.
	* I never wanted the modification stuff in here really, it was
	just feature creep. Feh is a viewer and montager. That is all :)

Tue Jan 11 21:11:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hrm. Just so you know what order they come in, the images are
	  now saved in /tmp (actually whatever tempdir is set up on your
	  system) in the format "number"_"unique bit"_"original filename"

Tue Jan 11 20:52:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay. The cached images are now deleted. The filenames are no
	  longer crap. ("Unique prefix"_feh_"original filename")
	* New option -k, --keep-http, tell feh *not* to delete the files,
	  so that you can later claim them from /tmp. Saves you
	  downloading them again if you like them.
	* A happy side effect of this is that if you use -k and -R to keep
	  http and reload, and point the thing at a webcam, you'll capture
	  each frame and save it as a separate image.
	* I *can't* imagine why anyone would *want* that, but I thought
	  I'd pass it on ;-)

Tue Jan 11 19:51:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Caching of images loaded via http. When in slideshow mode, and
	  the --reload option is not specified, a file loaded by http will
	  be stored in /tmp to avoid reloading from the web it every time
	  you loop through the slideshow or whatever.
	* The --reload option disables caching
	* Right now, the cached images are left in temp with crap
	  filenames. I'm gonna fix it up so that they are normally deleted
	  on program exit, but there will be an option to save them to the
	  current directory. (So you still have the images after viewing
	  them).

Tue Jan 11 19:07:07 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* New option, -R, --reload. Lets you specify a time in seconds,
	  feh will reload the image for you after this time. This works for
	  normal files and urls. The image will not be cached, so it is
	  ideal for viewing webcam images etc.

Mon Jan 10 22:48:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Whee. Now feh can load images from urls.
	* Specify an image starting with http:// and feh will use wget to
	  load the image, store it in a temporary file and view it.
	* You must have wget installed for this to work.
	* I have some optimisations to add, the image is currently not
	  cached, so if you have http files in a slideshow, they will reload
	  each time you get to them ;) I'll do this soon.

Sat Jan  8 18:44:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Finally got around to adding timers to feh. Now there is a new
	  option, -D, or --slideshow-delay NUM. NUM is the time in seconds
	  between changing slides for you. There is a new test to
	  demonstrate this option.
	* The timer will pause while you zoom, and will be reset if you
	  change slides yourself.
	* The timers code is loosely based on raster's epplet timer
	  code, 'cos its cool. No need to re-invent the wheel ;)

Mon Jan  3 18:29:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay. feh is now capable of some minor touch-ups. Nothing major,
	and no image saving yet, but it tests the selection and
	modification code.
	* We're not writing a full-blown editor here... The idea is to
	browse through your images, select one, make minor changes if you
	want, then set it as your desktop background.
	* To test, toggle the various modes and use the left mouse button
	to use 'em.
	* 'c' - crop image to rectangle
	* 'o' - increase contrast of rectangle
	* 'b' - increase brightness of rectangle
	* 'g' - increase gamma of rectangle
	* 'Escape' - exit modification mode.
	* I'll leave the rest of the modification stuff to Andrew ;-) I
	guess maybe we should have some persistant rectangle selections,
	but I don't want to go too far.

Sat Jan  1 22:25:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* I prefer LineOnOffDash drawing more for selections :)

Sat Jan  1 22:12:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* I'm alive!!! Somewhat hungover though ;)
	* So, some changes to the rectangle selection code, some by
	Andrew, some by me :) Again, press 'r' to test it.

Sun Dec 26 22:57:53 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Take the gc creation out of the loop, as much as poss.
	* Is xmas over now?
	* Am I still drunk?

Fri Dec 24 13:22:19 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* I've switched to using XFindContext et al to associate X Windows
	with internal structures. Much faster than my rubbish list
	searching.
	* Dammit. Why don't people tell me you can *do* stuff like this ;)

Fri Dec 24 01:01:49 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* And now we can crop :) Thanks Andrew.

Thu Dec 23 20:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* We can now draw selection rectangles on windows using XORed
	lines. This rules. Once the editing functions and menus are in
	place, we'll use them to do stuff :)
	* For now, press r to toggle line drawing, so you can see it for
	yourself. Click and drag lmb to see.

Wed Dec 22 23:37:27 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More stuff from Andrew (hoss), we're starting to add stuff for
	drawing rectangles, applying mods to rectangles, setting
	backgrounds (under any wm) and other stuff like that.

Wed Dec 22 21:49:10 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Memory usage down by ONE THIRD :)
	* I finally did the checkerboard bg thing the Right Way, and saved
	lots of wasted RAM. Hooray.

Wed Dec 22 20:47:11 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* And now index mode has a go at recommending the image size for
	you, if you specify one too small.

Wed Dec 22 18:23:42 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hehe. Found it. Little bugger. *squish*

Wed Dec 22 18:12:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More modify.c submissions from Andrew, including the start of
	some very funky background setting and image scaling ::)
	* A total rewrite of the index generating code to take into
	account the font size and string length. The old version was
	pretty unflim, so its nice to clean it up a bit. However, the niew
	code still has a couple of issues, which I am looking into.

Wed Dec 22 13:21:12 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay, index mode now kinda takes into account the height of the
	font you use. Width is on its way, but is more tricky.

Wed Dec 22 02:17:01 1999  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	* Removed a warning, and added "make testclean"

Tue Dec 21 23:28:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More modify.c submissions from Andrew, and some initial menu
	work. The menus are not compiled in right now, and would core if I
	did, so don't touch 'em for now :) They are only 5 mins work atm.
	* I have #ifdef'ed out the code which uses X86VidMode extensions
	until I can find out how common it is not to have them :)

Tue Dec 21 18:40:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The winwidget_rerender_image() function now checks for changed
	dimensions and acts accordingly, and the rotate() function now
	updates the width and height attributes. The modify.c functions
	are now available for testing using 1-9, 0, -, = key presses.

Tue Dec 21 18:01:15 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Encorporated modify.c, contributed by Andrew Glover
	<aglover@axe.net>. These functions wrap imlib2 modification
	functions, and will be handy when I make some menus :) We'll be
	able to do scaling, tiling, color modifiers, and more.

Tue Dec 21 03:28:30 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* And now the thing won't go mad when you hold down a change-slide
	button in Slideshow mode... Before it stored *all* the KeyPresses
	and responded to *all* of them. Hehe. It was fun watching it go
	round though :)

Mon Dec 20 17:35:25 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hehe. Ooops. I only need to blend on zoom if the image *has* an
	alpha channel. Hehe. Ok, now zooming is *much* faster and
	smoother, and I am slightly less of an idiot.

Mon Dec 20 16:46:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay, I'm still a newbie at this X stuff :) Made some
	optimisations to the main loop which speed things up a
	bunch.
	* Added better error handling when loading images.
	* The Q or q key can now be used to exit the app in any mode.

Mon Dec 20 15:22:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added some utility functions, so I don't have to write
	if((s=malloc(blah))==NULL){fprintf("oops\n");exit(2);}
	15 million times. It really bugs me ;-)

	* Hehe. I like slideshow mode so much its now the default :)
	Having multiple images pop up one-per-window can be quite evil, so
	Slideshow mode is prefered. To open multiple images
	one-per-window, you now need to specify -w or -multiwindow.
	* I also fixed a couple of things, lowered slideshow overhead,
	tightened up the main loop somewhat, and a coupla things really
	late last night which I can't remember ;-)

Sun Dec 19 22:06:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* For packaging reasons, I have changed the scripts to run feh in
	the current dir, if it is there, but to fall back on the installed
	copy.

Sun Dec 19 20:29:33 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a .spec file for feh. Contributed by Alistair Sutton
	<metallica@freenet.co.uk>, (who is obviously a metallica fan ;), 
	and has written specs for me before ::) Thanks dude :)
	* Urm. I haven't actually tested this yet :)

Sun Dec 19 18:55:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Slideshow mode now has keyboard control ::)
	Mouse button 1 still changes slides, but you now have:
	p, P, <BACKSPACE>, <LEFT>  Goto previous slide
	n, N, <SPACE>, <RIGHT>     Goto next slide
	<HOME>                     Goto first slide
	<END>                      Goto last slide
	<DELETE>                   Delete the file currently being viewed
	q, Q                       Quit the slideshow

	More to come.

Sun Dec 19 15:43:07 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Big performance improvements in the main loop. Squashed another
	couple of bugs, and made things real stable. Tightened up the
	tests somewhat, and split the source up more clearly.

Sun Dec 19 02:58:35 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Fixed a number of bugs introduced by the new progressive loading
	and zooming code ::)

Sat Dec 18 22:11:02 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Whee. Progressive loading works :) It can be disabled with -P,
	--noprogressive, if you don't want it. Can't think why though. It
	rocks. Thanks again go to Raster. Progressive loading callbacks
	*rule*.

Sat Dec 18 18:15:18 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The fonts are now installed, and loaded from the installation
	directory.

Sat Dec 18 15:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay then, there is now a checkerboard background when
	zooming out. There is a more memory efficent way of doing this,
	but I'll do that later...

Sat Dec 18 14:31:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Wheeeee! Thanks to Raster's example code, we now have zooming
	Raster, you are my hero :)
	So, middle-mouse button and drag -> zoom.
	There are some things to tidy up (eg adding a background when
	zooming out), but these are trivial compared to getting the
	zooming working with multiple windows, which I just did ::)

Fri Dec 17 22:00:57 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added titles to index prints. A title will only be printed if
	you specify --title-font.

Fri Dec 17 21:33:55 1999  Michael Jennings  <mej@eterm.org>

	* Added "make test" to run the test scripts one by one.

Fri Dec 17 21:32:16 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added more info the the index output :) Try test14 now :)

Fri Dec 17 21:01:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a couple of fonts, found one small for doing index prints,
	tidied the directory structure a bit.

Fri Dec 17 18:37:14 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added some new options, here's an excerpt from --help
	-S, --slideshow  Enable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead
                         of opening multiple windows for multiple image
                         files, one window will be opened. Press mouse
                         button one to flick through the images.
	-i, --index      Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to
                         montage mode, and accepts the same options. It
                         creates an index print of thumbails, printing user-
                         defined information beneath each thumbnail. Index
                         mode enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE
                         OPTIONS
	-f FONT          Use FONT to print the information under each
                         thumbnail. FONT should be defined in the form
                         fontname/size(points). eg -f myfont/12
	Now all I need is a font which is legible in very small point :)
	I also added a couple of new tests for these options.

Fri Dec 17 03:09:46 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Made the test scripts more verbose. It appears that people who
	run a test called test07_bork_non_image_files still expect it to
	work ;) hehe.

Fri Dec 17 02:09:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Right-clicking in multi-image mode now closes ALL windows. I'll
	add a popup menu soon.

Thu Dec 16 22:58:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Changed --help output to fit into 80 characters...

Thu Dec 16 22:10:50 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Initial import. Feh is currently at 0.5.0 release level.
