	* Added some new options, here's an excerpt from --help
	-S, --slideshow  Enable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead
                         of opening multiple windows for multiple image
                         files, one window will be opened. Press mouse
                         button one to flick through the images.
	-i, --index      Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to
                         montage mode, and accepts the same options. It
                         creates an index print of thumbails, printing user-
                         defined information beneath each thumbnail. Index
                         mode enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE
                         OPTIONS
	-f FONT          Use FONT to print the information under each
                         thumbnail. FONT should be defined in the form
                         fontname/size(points). eg -f myfont/12
	Now all I need is a font which is legible in very small point :)
	I also added a couple of new tests for these options.

	* Made the test scripts more verbose. It appears that people who
	run a test called test07_bork_non_image_files still expect it to
	work ;) hehe.

	* Right-clicking in multi-image mode now closes ALL windows. I'll
	add a popup menu soon.
