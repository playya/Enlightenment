	* Slideshow mode now has keyboard control ::)
	Mouse button 1 still changes slides, but you now have:
	p, P, <BACKSPACE>, <LEFT>  Goto previous slide
	n, N, <SPACE>, <RIGHT>     Goto next slide
	<HOME>                     Goto first slide
	<END>                      Goto last slide
	<DELETE>                   Delete the file currently being viewed
	q, Q                       Quit the slideshow

	More to come.

	* Big performance improvements in the main loop. Squashed another
	couple of bugs, and made things real stable. Tightened up the
	tests somewhat, and split the source up more clearly.

Sun Dec 19 02:58:35 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Fixed a number of bugs introduced by the new progressive loading
	and zooming code ::)

Sat Dec 18 22:11:02 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Whee. Progressive loading works :) It can be disabled with -P,
	--noprogressive, if you don't want it. Can't think why though. It
	rocks. Thanks again go to Raster. Progressive loading callbacks
	*rule*.

Sat Dec 18 18:15:18 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The fonts are now installed, and loaded from the installation
	directory.

Sat Dec 18 15:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay then, there is now a checkerboard background when
	zooming out. There is a more memory efficent way of doing this,
	but I'll do that later...

Sat Dec 18 14:31:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Wheeeee! Thanks to Raster's example code, we now have zooming
	Raster, you are my hero :)
	So, middle-mouse button and drag -> zoom.
	There are some things to tidy up (eg adding a background when
	zooming out), but these are trivial compared to getting the
	zooming working with multiple windows, which I just did ::)

Fri Dec 17 22:00:57 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added titles to index prints. A title will only be printed if
	you specify --title-font.

Fri Dec 17 21:33:55 1999  Michael Jennings  <mej@eterm.org>

	* Added "make test" to run the test scripts one by one.

Fri Dec 17 21:32:16 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added more info the the index output :) Try test14 now :)

Fri Dec 17 21:01:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a couple of fonts, found one small for doing index prints,
	tidied the directory structure a bit.

Fri Dec 17 18:37:14 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added some new options, here's an excerpt from --help
	-S, --slideshow  Enable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead
                         of opening multiple windows for multiple image
                         files, one window will be opened. Press mouse
                         button one to flick through the images.
	-i, --index      Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to
                         montage mode, and accepts the same options. It
                         creates an index print of thumbails, printing user-
                         defined information beneath each thumbnail. Index
                         mode enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE
                         OPTIONS
	-f FONT          Use FONT to print the information under each
                         thumbnail. FONT should be defined in the form
                         fontname/size(points). eg -f myfont/12
	Now all I need is a font which is legible in very small point :)
	I also added a couple of new tests for these options.

Fri Dec 17 03:09:46 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Made the test scripts more verbose. It appears that people who
	run a test called test07_bork_non_image_files still expect it to
	work ;) hehe.

Fri Dec 17 02:09:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Right-clicking in multi-image mode now closes ALL windows. I'll
	add a popup menu soon.

Thu Dec 16 22:58:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Changed --help output to fit into 80 characters...

Thu Dec 16 22:10:50 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Initial import. Feh is currently at 0.5.0 release level.
