Sat Jan  1 22:25:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* I prefer LineOnOffDash drawing more for selections :)

Sat Jan  1 22:12:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* I'm alive!!! Somewhat hungover though ;)
	* So, some changes to the rectangle selection code, some by
	Andrew, some by me :) Again, press 'r' to test it.

Sun Dec 26 22:57:53 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Take the gc creation out of the loop, as much as poss.
	* Is xmas over now?
	* Am I still drunk?

Fri Dec 24 13:22:19 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* I've switched to using XFindContext et al to associate X Windows
	with internal structures. Much faster than my rubbish list
	searching.
	* Dammit. Why don't people tell me you can *do* stuff like this ;)

Fri Dec 24 01:01:49 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* And now we can crop :) Thanks Andrew.

Thu Dec 23 20:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* We can now draw selection rectangles on windows using XORed
	lines. This rules. Once the editing functions and menus are in
	place, we'll use them to do stuff :)
	* For now, press r to toggle line drawing, so you can see it for
	yourself. Click and drag lmb to see.

Wed Dec 22 23:37:27 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More stuff from Andrew (hoss), we're starting to add stuff for
	drawing rectangles, applying mods to rectangles, setting
	backgrounds (under any wm) and other stuff like that.

Wed Dec 22 21:49:10 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Memory usage down by ONE THIRD :)
	* I finally did the checkerboard bg thing the Right Way, and saved
	lots of wasted RAM. Hooray.

Wed Dec 22 20:47:11 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* And now index mode has a go at recommending the image size for
	you, if you specify one too small.

Wed Dec 22 18:23:42 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hehe. Found it. Little bugger. *squish*

Wed Dec 22 18:12:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More modify.c submissions from Andrew, including the start of
	some very funky background setting and image scaling ::)
	* A total rewrite of the index generating code to take into
	account the font size and string length. The old version was
	pretty unflim, so its nice to clean it up a bit. However, the niew
	code still has a couple of issues, which I am looking into.

Wed Dec 22 13:21:12 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay, index mode now kinda takes into account the height of the
	font you use. Width is on its way, but is more tricky.

Wed Dec 22 02:17:01 1999  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	* Removed a warning, and added "make testclean"

Tue Dec 21 23:28:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* More modify.c submissions from Andrew, and some initial menu
	work. The menus are not compiled in right now, and would core if I
	did, so don't touch 'em for now :) They are only 5 mins work atm.
	* I have #ifdef'ed out the code which uses X86VidMode extensions
	until I can find out how common it is not to have them :)

Tue Dec 21 18:40:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The winwidget_rerender_image() function now checks for changed
	dimensions and acts accordingly, and the rotate() function now
	updates the width and height attributes. The modify.c functions
	are now available for testing using 1-9, 0, -, = key presses.

Tue Dec 21 18:01:15 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Encorporated modify.c, contributed by Andrew Glover
	<aglover@axe.net>. These functions wrap imlib2 modification
	functions, and will be handy when I make some menus :) We'll be
	able to do scaling, tiling, color modifiers, and more.

Tue Dec 21 03:28:30 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* And now the thing won't go mad when you hold down a change-slide
	button in Slideshow mode... Before it stored *all* the KeyPresses
	and responded to *all* of them. Hehe. It was fun watching it go
	round though :)

Mon Dec 20 17:35:25 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hehe. Ooops. I only need to blend on zoom if the image *has* an
	alpha channel. Hehe. Ok, now zooming is *much* faster and
	smoother, and I am slightly less of an idiot.

Mon Dec 20 16:46:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay, I'm still a newbie at this X stuff :) Made some
	optimisations to the main loop which speed things up a
	bunch.
	* Added better error handling when loading images.
	* The Q or q key can now be used to exit the app in any mode.

Mon Dec 20 15:22:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added some utility functions, so I don't have to write
	if((s=malloc(blah))==NULL){fprintf("oops\n");exit(2);}
	15 million times. It really bugs me ;-)

Mon Dec 20 12:53:28 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Hehe. I like slideshow mode so much its now the default :)
	Having multiple images pop up one-per-window can be quite evil, so
	Slideshow mode is prefered. To open multiple images
	one-per-window, you now need to specify -w or -multiwindow.
	* I also fixed a couple of things, lowered slideshow overhead,
	tightened up the main loop somewhat, and a coupla things really
	late last night which I can't remember ;-)

Sun Dec 19 22:06:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* For packaging reasons, I have changed the scripts to run feh in
	the current dir, if it is there, but to fall back on the installed
	copy.

Sun Dec 19 20:29:33 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a .spec file for feh. Contributed by Alistair Sutton
	<metallica@freenet.co.uk>, (who is obviously a metallica fan ;), 
	and has written specs for me before ::) Thanks dude :)
	* Urm. I haven't actually tested this yet :)

Sun Dec 19 18:55:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Slideshow mode now has keyboard control ::)
	Mouse button 1 still changes slides, but you now have:
	p, P, <BACKSPACE>, <LEFT>  Goto previous slide
	n, N, <SPACE>, <RIGHT>     Goto next slide
	<HOME>                     Goto first slide
	<END>                      Goto last slide
	<DELETE>                   Delete the file currently being viewed
	q, Q                       Quit the slideshow

	More to come.

Sun Dec 19 15:43:07 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Big performance improvements in the main loop. Squashed another
	couple of bugs, and made things real stable. Tightened up the
	tests somewhat, and split the source up more clearly.

Sun Dec 19 02:58:35 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Fixed a number of bugs introduced by the new progressive loading
	and zooming code ::)

Sat Dec 18 22:11:02 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Whee. Progressive loading works :) It can be disabled with -P,
	--noprogressive, if you don't want it. Can't think why though. It
	rocks. Thanks again go to Raster. Progressive loading callbacks
	*rule*.

Sat Dec 18 18:15:18 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The fonts are now installed, and loaded from the installation
	directory.

Sat Dec 18 15:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Okay then, there is now a checkerboard background when
	zooming out. There is a more memory efficent way of doing this,
	but I'll do that later...

Sat Dec 18 14:31:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Wheeeee! Thanks to Raster's example code, we now have zooming
	Raster, you are my hero :)
	So, middle-mouse button and drag -> zoom.
	There are some things to tidy up (eg adding a background when
	zooming out), but these are trivial compared to getting the
	zooming working with multiple windows, which I just did ::)

Fri Dec 17 22:00:57 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added titles to index prints. A title will only be printed if
	you specify --title-font.

Fri Dec 17 21:33:55 1999  Michael Jennings  <mej@eterm.org>

	* Added "make test" to run the test scripts one by one.

Fri Dec 17 21:32:16 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added more info the the index output :) Try test14 now :)

Fri Dec 17 21:01:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a couple of fonts, found one small for doing index prints,
	tidied the directory structure a bit.

Fri Dec 17 18:37:14 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added some new options, here's an excerpt from --help
	-S, --slideshow  Enable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead
                         of opening multiple windows for multiple image
                         files, one window will be opened. Press mouse
                         button one to flick through the images.
	-i, --index      Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to
                         montage mode, and accepts the same options. It
                         creates an index print of thumbails, printing user-
                         defined information beneath each thumbnail. Index
                         mode enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE
                         OPTIONS
	-f FONT          Use FONT to print the information under each
                         thumbnail. FONT should be defined in the form
                         fontname/size(points). eg -f myfont/12
	Now all I need is a font which is legible in very small point :)
	I also added a couple of new tests for these options.

Fri Dec 17 03:09:46 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Made the test scripts more verbose. It appears that people who
	run a test called test07_bork_non_image_files still expect it to
	work ;) hehe.

Fri Dec 17 02:09:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Right-clicking in multi-image mode now closes ALL windows. I'll
	add a popup menu soon.

Thu Dec 16 22:58:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Changed --help output to fit into 80 characters...

Thu Dec 16 22:10:50 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Initial import. Feh is currently at 0.5.0 release level.
