- Overview
This script will generate a menu of cam bookmarks for Enlightenment

an another entry to the left-click menu if it's already been run once.
It doesn't delete any existing menu entries, and it backs up your
existing menu files as well. (just in case I screwed up.. hehe).  THe
script is commented; feel free to open it up to uncover it's dark
secrets.
