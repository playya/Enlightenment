.SH NAME
feh - image viewer and cataloguer
.SH SYNOPSIS
feh [options] file(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B feh
is an image viewer using the
.B imlib2
library to open and manipulate images.
.B feh
has a large number of operational modes. The default mode is an image
slideshow, showing one image at a time from those specified on the
commandline. Keys and mouse control may be used to move through them. Other
modes can be specified on the commandline, and are described below.
.PP
.B feh
can also recurse through a directory structure to form a filelist for
processing, and will convert directory names on the commandline into a list
of their contents automatically.
.PP
.B Filelists
can be sorted in a number of ways. The default is the order the files were
specified on the commandline, or the order they were read from the disk. You
can specify sorting modes such as
.B
randomize
or you can sort by filename, image name, width, height, pixels, etc.
Filelists can also be saved to or loaded from files.
.SH MODES
.B Montage mode
forms a montage from the filelist. The resultant image can be viewed or
saved, and it's size can be limited by height, width or both.
.PP
.B Collage mode
is very similar to montage mode, except the images are distributed randomly
and may overlap eachother
.PP
.B Index mode
forms an index print from the filelist. Image thumbnails are shown along
with the filename, filesize and pixel size, printed using a truetype font of
your choice. The resultant image can be viewed or saved, and it's size can
be limited by height, width or both.
.PP
.B Thumbnail mode
is like index mode, but the mini-images are clickable, and launch the
clicked image in a browser window.
.PP
.B Multiwindow mode
shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a slideshow in one window.
Don't use with a large filelist ;)
.PP
.B Fullscreen mode
shows image in fullscreen view, can be combined with a slide-change delay to
show an automated presentation.
.PP
.B List mode
doesn't display images. Outputs an 'ls'-style listing of the files in the
filelist, including image info such as size, pixels, type, etc. Customlist
mode will display whatever image info you want, in the format you choose.
.PP
.B feh
can also list either all the loadable files in a filelist or all the
unloadable files. Useful for preening a directory.
.PP
.B feh
also has the ability to load files over http or ftp, simply specify the url
on the commandline.
.PP
.B feh
can read options from the commandline, or from a config file. The syntax
is the same in each case. See
.B CONFIG FILE SYNTAX
for details about using themes defined in a config file.
These methods may be used in conjunction.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -h, --help
display help output and exit
.TP 5
.B -v, --version
output version information and exit
.TP 5
.B -V, --verbose
output useful information, progress bars, etc
.TP 5
.B -q, --quiet
Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads. Verbose and quiet modes
are not mutually exclusive, the first controls informational messages,
the second only errors.
.TP 5
.B -T, --theme THEME
Load options from config file with name THEME - see CONFIG FILE SYNTAX for more info.
.TP 5
.B --rcfile FILE
Use FILE to parse themes and options from,
instead of the default ~/.fehrc, /etc/fehrc files.
.TP 5
.B -r, --recursive
Recursively expand any directories in FILE to the content of those
directories, all the way down to the bottom level. (Take it easy)
.TP 5
.B -z, --randomize
When viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomise the file list before
displaying.
.TP 5
.B -f, --filelist FILE
This option is similar to the playlists used by music software. If FILE
exists, it will be read for a list of files to load, in the order they
appear. The format is a list of image filenames, absolute or relative to the
current directory, one filename per line.
.br
If FILE doesn't exist, it will be created from the internal filelist at the
end of a viewing session.  This is best used to store the results of complex
sorts (-Spixels for example) for later viewing.  Any changes to the internal
filelist (such as deleting a file or it being pruned for being unloadable)
will be saved to FILE when feh exits. You can add files to filelists by
specifying them on the commandline when also specifying the list.
.TP 5
.B -p, --preload
Preload images. This doesn't mean hold them in RAM, it means run through
them and eliminate unloadable images first. Otherwise they will be removed
as you flick through. This also analyses the images to get data for use in
sorting, such as pixel size, type etc. A preload run will be automatically
performed if you specify one of these sort modes.
.TP 5
.B -F, --full-screen
Make the window fullscreen
.TP 5
.B -g, --geometry STRING
Limit (and don't change) the window size. Takes
an X-style geometry string like 640x480.
Note that larger images will be zoomed out to fit
but you can see them at 1:1 by clicking the zoom
button.
.TP 5
.B -Z, --auto-zoom
Zoom picture to screen size in fullscreen (affected by --stretch and
--ignore-aspect).
.TP 5
.B -w, --multiwindow
Disable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead of opening multiple
files in slideshow mode, multiple windows will be opened, one per file.
.TP 5
.B -x, --borderless
Create borderless windows
.TP 5
.B -d, --draw-filename
Draw the filename at the top-left of the image
.TP 5
.B -D, --slideshow-delay NUM
For slideshow mode, specifies time delay (seconds, can be a decimal) between automatically
changing slides. Great for presentations.
.TP 5
.B -R, --reload NUM
Use this option to tell
.B feh
to reload an image after NUM seconds. Useful for viewing webcams via http,
or even on your local machine.
.TP 5
.B -k, --keep-http
When viewing files using http, feh normally deletes the local copies after
viewing, or, if caching, on exit. This option prevents this so that you
get to keep the local copies. They will be in /tmp with "feh" in the name.
.TP 5
.B -Q, --wget
Use wget to grab remote files instead of builtin mechanism, useful if you
need to use a proxy or something.
.TP 5
.B -l, --list
Don't display images. Analyse them and display an 'ls'-style listing.
Useful in scripts hunt out images of a certain size/resolution/type etc.
.TP 5
.B -L, --customlist FORMAT
Use FORMAT as the format specifier for list
output. FORMAT is a printf-like string containing
image info specifiers. See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.
.TP 5
.B -U, --loadable
Don't display images. Just print out their names if imlib2 can successfully
load them.
.TP 5
.B -u, --unloadable
Don't display images. Just print out their name if imlib2 can NOT
successfully load them.
.TP 5
.B -S, --sort SORT_TYPE
The file list may be sorted according to image parameters. Allowed sort
types are: name, filename, width, height, pixels, size, format. For sort
modes other than name or filename, a preload run will be necessary,
causing a delay proportional to the number of images in the list
.TP 5
.B -n, --reverse
Reverse the sort order. Use this to invert the order of the filelist. Eg
to sort in reverse width order, use
.B -nSwidth
.TP 5
.B -A, --action ACTION
Specify a string as an action to perform on the image. In slideshow or
multiwindow modes, the action will be run when the enter key is pressed, in
list mode, the action will be run for each file listed. The action will be
executed by /bin/sh. Use format specifiers to refer to image info. See
FORMAT SPECIFIERS for examples
.br
Eg. feh -A "mv %f ~/images/%n" *
.br
In slideshow mode, the next image will be shown after running the action,
in multiwindow mode, the window will be closed.
.TP 5
.B -m, --montage
Enable montage mode. Montage mode creates a new image consisting of a grid
of thumbnails of the images in the filelist. When montage mode is selected,
certain other options become available. See MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -c, --collage
Enable collage mode. Collage mode is very similar to montage mode, except
the images are distributed randomly.
.TP 5
.B -i, --index
Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to montage mode, and accepts the
same options. It creates an index print of thumbails, printing the image
name beneath each thumbnail. Index mode enables certain other options, see
INDEX MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -I, --fullindex
Same as Index mode, but you also get image size and dimensions printed
below each thumbnail.
.TP 5
.B -t, --thumbnails
Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image launchers.
.TP 5
.B --bg-tile FILE
.TP 5
.B --bg-center FILE
.TP 5
.B --bg-scale FILE
.TP 5
.B --bg-seamless FILE
Set your desktop background to FILE. Feh
can use enlightenment IPC if you are running
it, or will fall back to X methods.
Feh stores the commandline necessary to restore
the background you chose in ~/.fehbg. So to have
feh-set backgrounds restored when you restart X,
add the line "eval `cat $HOME/.fehbg`" to your
X startup script (e.g. ~/.xsession). Note that
you only need to do this for non E window
managers.
.TP 5
.B -M, --menu-font FONT
Use FONT for the font in menus.
.TP 5
.B --menu-bg BG
Use BG for the background image in menus.
.TP 5
.B -N, --no-menus
Don't load or show any menus.
.TP 5
.B -1, --next-button B
Use button B to advance to the next image in slideshow
mode (defaults to 1, usually the left button).
.TP 5
.B -2, --zoom-button B
Use button B to zoom the current image in any
mode (defaults to 2, usually the middle button).
.TP 5
.B -3, --pan-button B
Use button B to pan the current image in any mode (defaults to 3, usually the right button).
.TP 5
.B     --no-pan-ctrl-mask
Don't require CTRL+Button for panning in any mode -- just use the button (default=off).
.TP 5
.B -4, --menu-button B
Use CTRL+Button B to activate the menu in any mode.  Set to 0 to use any
button.  This option is disabled if the -N or --no-menus option is set
(defaults to 3, usually the right button).
.TP 5
.B -5, --no-menu-ctrl-mask
Don't require CTRL+Button for menu activation in any mode -- just use the button (default=off).
.TP 5
.B -6, --rotate-button B
Use CTRL+Button B to rotate the current image in any mode (default=2).
.TP 5
.B -7, --no-rotate-ctrl-mask
Don't require CTRL+Button for rotation in any mode -- just use the button (default=off).
.TP 5
.B -8, --blur-button B
Use CTRL+Button B to blur the current image in any mode (default=1).

.SH MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -X, --ignore-aspect
By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect ratios, while
fitting in --thumb-width and --thumb-height. This option will force them to
be the size set by --thumb-width and --thumb-height This will prevent any
whitespace in the final montage
.TP 5
.B -s, --stretch
Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail size, it will
not be enlarged. If this option is set, the image will be scaled up to fit
the thumnail size. (Aspect ratio will be maintained unless --ignore-aspect is
specified)
.TP 5
.B -y, --thumb-width NUM
Set thumbnail width in pixels
.TP 5
.B -E, --thumb-height NUM
Set thumbnail height in pixels
Thumbnails default to 20x20 pixels
.TP 5
.B -W, --limit-width NUM
Limit the width of the montage in pixels
.TP 5
.B -H, --limit-height NUM
Limit the height of the montage in pixels These options can be used together
(to define the image size exactly), or separately. If only one is specified,
theother is calculated from the number of files specified and the size of
the thumbnails.  The default is to limit width to 800 pixels and calculate
the height as necessary
.TP 5
.B -b, --bg FILE|trans
Use FILE as a background for your montage. With this option specified, the
size of the montage will default to the size of FILE if no size restrictions
are specified. Alternatively, if FILE is 'trans', the background will be
made transparent.
.TP 5
.B -a, --alpha NUM
When drawing thumbnails onto the background, apply them with a transparency
level of NUM (0-255).
.TP 5
.B -o FILE
Save the created montage to FILE
.TP 5
.B -O FILE
Just save the created montage to FILE without displaying it (use in scripts)
.SH INDEX MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -e, --font FONT
Use FONT to print the information under each thumbnail. FONT should be a
truetype font, resident in the current directory, or in feh's font
directory, and should be defined in the form fontname/size(points). (No
extension). eg. --font myfont/12
.TP 5
.B --fontpath PATH
Specify PATH as an extra directory in which to search for fonts, can use
multiple times to add multiple paths, e.g --fontpath /path/a --fontpath
/path/b.
.TP 5
.B --title-font FONT
Use FONT to print a title on the index, if no font is specified, a title
will not be printed
.SH CONFIG FILE SYNTAX
The feh config file allows the naming of option groups, or themes.
If
.B $HOME/.fehrc
exists, or if not, but
.B /etc/fehrc
exists, feh will look in it for theme name/options pairs. If neither
$HOME/.fehrc or /etc/fehrc exist, feh will create a default one in ~/.fehrc.
An example entry would be:
.br
.B imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30
.br
You can then use this theme in two ways. Either
.br
.B feh --theme imagemap *.jpg
.br
or you can create a symbolic link to feh with the name of the options you
want it to use. So from the example above:
.br
.B ln -s `which feh` ~/bin/imagemap
.br
Now I just run
.B imagemap *.jpg
to use those options. A cooler example is
.br
.B mkindex -iVO index.jpg --title-font 20thcent/24 .
.br
Notice the '.' at the end. Now with a symlink I can create a mkindex
command which will create an index.jpg in the current directory. I just
run
.B mkindex
to do it.
.br
You can combine these themes with commandline options, they will be
combined. So in the example above, typing
.B mkindex -q
will create and index, suppressing error messages.
An example.fehrc is provided with a couple of cool examples.
.SH SLIDESHOW KEYS

.SH MOUSE ACTIONS
When viewing an image, mouse button 1 moves to the next image (slideshow
mode only), button 2 zooms (click and drag left->right to zoom in, right->
left to zoom out, click once to restore 1x zoom), and mouse button 3 pans.
Ctrl+button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur and right to
sharpen).  Ctrl+button 2 rotates the image around the center point.  Ctrl+
button 3 activates the context-sensitive menu.  Buttons can be redefined
with the -1 through -9 (or --*-button) cmdline flags.  All you people
with million button mice can remove the ctrl mask with the --no-*-ctrl-mask
options.
