	What Is It?

E-Notes is a sticky notes system based on the enlightenment
libraries.  It is aimed at being a functionable, easy to use
and nice to look at themable sticky notes system which should
prove to be helpful on many peoples unix workstations.

It is programmed in C and requires autoconf, automake, aclocal,
make, libtool, gettext, libltdl and the standard libraries.

Also, libxml2 is required for E-Notes to function correctly.

Not forgetting of course the enlightenment libraries:
	Evas
	Ecore
        Edb
        Edje
	Ewl
