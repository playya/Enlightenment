    BUGS & BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:

I'm liking this! :)

    FEATURES:

Pull content and title for all "new notes" from a file rather than the defined values. 
Optional change of location for note storage to a http based (post/get) method.
Investigate the "timing" of a note, as an alert.
Option for automatic saving of all open notes on exit and loading on startup (us
e separate storage file for this, always local).
Add an option to disable the control centre, but make sure the IPC supports the closing of enotes before you do this!
