* NOTE THAT THE DEMO WILL NOT WORK INLESS IT IS INSTALLED !! *

* The library must be installed for anything to happen */



it currently needs evas, gtk+ to work 
(and very possibly edb... I think the make needs it now, and
in the future gevas will prolly need it so that gevas can
load edb files, though this may be optional)


it will prolly use edb and ebits libs in future to allow
widgets to be loaded from a ebit file.



cd src; ./autogen and make; make install

the demo can be made seperately in the demo dir.


I made the demo seperate so that newbies can swipe the automake/conf
config for their own project.
