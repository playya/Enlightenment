it currently needs evas, gtk+ to work 
(and very possibly edb... I think the make needs it now, and
in the future gevas will prolly need it so that gevas can
load edb files, though this may be optional)


it will prolly use edb and ebits libs in future to allow
widgets to be loaded from a ebit file.



./autogen.sh && make

you can run the demo then by typing:

demo/testgevas
