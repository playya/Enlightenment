you should be able to build and install gevas simply by running 

./autogen.sh
make

and then you can test by running the demo :
demo/testgevas

The following are some interesting things...


To use gevas inside a gtk_scrolled_window one must add it 
using gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport()


I have tried to model some of the API after GnomeCanvas.

Use tools/Imlib2Convert to plomp image files into an edb for sprites/images
eg.
Imlib2Convert cell1.png db data.db:cell/0/Image
and set data.db:cell/0/Location to path/to/db/data.db#edb?prefix=cell/0/Image
