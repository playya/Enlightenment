Initial release (entries from TODO file)
---------------

* Add an redraw() method so that users can manualy tell the
	gevas to redraw itself.
	gevas_queue_redraw()

* 
* rename show to gevasobj_show() and other functions need leading
	prefix... tdl, make c++ wrapper so that this monsterous
	naming scheme of gtk+ does not impact my other projects.

* gevas has all events in its _event() widget callback.
  gevas must call evas evas_event_button_down() etc so 
  that evas demuxes events to the correct object.

  gevas has evas callbacks, in these it calls the GtkgEvasObj
  method to get a chain of EventHandlers. it then moves through
  these event handlers until end of list, or GEVAS_EVENT_CHOMP
  is returned from a handler.

* GtkgEvasObj that does much of the Evas_Object stuff.
	Be able to marry a GtkgEvasObject and a 
	GtkgEvasEventHandler so that you can attach drag / 
	resize on entry type generic functionality to a 
	GtkgEvasObject

* enlarge on mouse over event handler.

* drag event handlers
	+ make it take mouse pointer offset relative to Evas_Object so that
		it sets the x/y without making the Evas_Object jump at start.
		
* event handler that emits gtk signals.

* popup menu attacher event handlers
	-> have the evh_popup emit a signal whenever the menu is needed.

* Deleteing a gevas should kill all of the objects it has attached to it
	automatically.

* in gevas
#define EVASO_TO_GTKO(evaso) ((GtkObject*)0)
void 
_register_gevasobj( GtkgEvas* thisp, GtkObject* gobj )
{
}
	Note that EVASO_TO_GTKO() is untested... it is there but no testing done.

* Ability to set a bg for gevas to a filename (NO! bad idea. 
	let the user make a GtkgEvasImage and add it manually.)

* gevasobj function protos into header file.

* Compile without warnings.	(almost all gone, printf() remains, but
	use of printf will be removed soon)

* Clean up code, remove printf comments... 

* GtkgEvasText

* Alpha adjust event handler.

* New event handler to swap to mouse over / mouse down images on
	events, and back to "normal" image..

* evh for double / triple clicks.

* GtkgEvasGradient [ on hold re API info ]

* Make gtkgEvasImage use GtkgEvasObj* not GtkgEvasImage* so it is
	easier to code. Like using GtkWidget in gtk+

* Add full LGPL copyright to all headers and c files.

* Shared lib for it all.
