	Initial work on getting this sucker into CVS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 15:22:08 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	First compilable version.  Doesn't do much yet, though. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 17:05:04 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some widgets that do stuff....
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 20:41:58 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some initial group stuff.  Values are hard-coded for now.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 30 18:45:20 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Basically, this gives you an idea of how the opening screen will look.
	Not much yet as far as working functionality, though. :-)

	This is the first point at which you can actually play the Not Game
	with this program.  All the values are hard-coded, so configuring it
	requires some source code hacking, but it's playable.

	A working instructions box is now present.  If you're still wondering
	what the Not Game is, read that box ("Help" -> "How to Play...").
	:-)

	Oops.  Don't create more than one game window.  Thanks mandrake. :)

Tue Aug 31 19:13:29 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	At this point, the interface is pretty much finalized all around.
	The next step is to write the configuration engine, which will be a
	very pluggable version of Eterm's current parser, but will fix some of
	the flexibility problems in the current parser's design.  Once it's
	completed and tested, I plan to merge the new stuff back into Eterm.
