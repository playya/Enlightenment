Wed Aug 25 14:45:07 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Initial work on getting this sucker into CVS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 15:22:08 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	First compilable version.  Doesn't do much yet, though. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 17:05:04 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some widgets that do stuff....
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 20:41:58 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some initial group stuff.  Values are hard-coded for now.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 30 18:45:20 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Basically, this gives you an idea of how the opening screen will look.
	Not much yet as far as working functionality, though. :-)

	This is the first point at which you can actually play the Not Game
	with this program.  All the values are hard-coded, so configuring it
	requires some source code hacking, but it's playable.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 16:41:55 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	A working instructions box is now present.  If you're still wondering
	what the Not Game is, read that box ("Help" -> "How to Play...").
	:-)

Tue Aug 31 17:05:25 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Oops.  Don't create more than one game window.  Thanks mandrake. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 19:13:29 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	At this point, the interface is pretty much finalized all around.
	The next step is to write the configuration engine, which will be a
	very pluggable version of Eterm's current parser, but will fix some of
	the flexibility problems in the current parser's design.  Once it's
	completed and tested, I plan to merge the new stuff back into Eterm.

	Eterm's config parser has been updated, adapted, and incorporated
	into notgame.  It doesn't work yet, and there's still more cleaning up
	to do, but at least the thing compiles and runs now. =)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  7 19:20:03 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More work on the config file parser.  I still have to clean up the
	context switching and the state persistence, but at least it won't
	crash. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 14 16:11:39 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Got the config parser all fleshed out and working, and I made the
	player/player group section work.  We're about 80% of the way to a
	playable, customizable version.

	See notgame.cfg.dist for a sample config file; copy it to your home
	directory as "notgame.cfg" if you wanna play. :)
