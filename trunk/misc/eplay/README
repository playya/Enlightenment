Hi.  This is a little something I hacked out of qiv 1.1
qiv kinda did what I wanted, but not quite, so instead of writing my own
program I hacked together something called eplay from theirs.  their code is
GPL and now mine is too :)  I left all their names here in the credits since I
have no idea what parts of what they wrote.  This app takes a lot of memory,
and was mostly something I did to play a little animation as my screensaver

Feel free to do whatever you want to with this.

eplay 0.1 - Sat Oct 30 11:48:06 PDT 1999

--Mandrake

USAGE:

eplay <image1> <image2> <image3> ...

where imageN are graphics (all of the same size) that you want to use as
frames in your animation.  the first playthrough will be kinda slow, but since
it's a screensaver you usually see the subsequent plays anyways.  :)

just hit any key or mouse button to quit the screensaver.

HOW TO USE AS A SCREENSAVER:

you've got to have xautolock to run me as a screensaver.  find it from
http://freshmeat.net  here's an example of 

xautolock -time 5 -locker "eplay /home/mandrake/va-anim/*.jpg" &
