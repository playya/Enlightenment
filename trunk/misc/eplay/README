Hi.  This is a little something I hacked out of qiv 1.1
qiv kinda did what I wanted, but not quite, so instead of writing my own
program I hacked together something called eplay from theirs.  their code is
GPL and now mine is too :)  I left all their names here in the credits since I
have no idea what parts of what they wrote.  This app takes a lot of memory,
and was mostly something I did to play a little animation as my screensaver

Feel free to do whatever you want to with this.

eplay 0.1 - Sat Oct 30 11:48:06 PDT 1999

--Mandrake

USAGE:

eplay <image1> <image2> <image3> ...

where imageN are graphics (all of the same size) that you want to use as
frames in your animation.  the first playthrough will be kinda slow, but since
it's a screensaver you usually see the subsequent plays anyways.  :)

just hit any key or mouse button to quit the screensaver.

HOW TO USE AS A SCREENSAVER:

you've got to have xautolock to run me as a screensaver.  find it from
http://freshmeat.net  here's an example of 

xautolock -time 5 -locker "eplay /home/mandrake/va-anim/*.jpg" &

Misc:
-----

  Thanx to all programers, Owen Taylor and Rasterman (@REDHAT)
  for helping with patches and their knowledge :-)

  type "man qiv" for more information.
  See the Makefile if you have problems compiling.

  qiv is designed to work with gtk/gdk 1.0.x and 1.1.x, it also
  should work with ANY version of Imlib of Linux (Intel/Mac),
  Solaris (SunOS) and FreeBSD.


Center Problem:
---------------
  
  we use only GDK with qiv and no GTK.. so there is a big problem with
  centering windows on screen and each Window Manager handles this
  stuff by it own way :-( but we try to show the windows centered on
  screen..

  Window Mager/Enlightenment/fvwm2 etc. :
      You don't need to do anything.. (Makefile: WM_HANDLE=0 or "-w
      0")

  Kwm(KDE)/SCWM etc. :
      You must set "-DWM_HANDLE=1" in the Makefile or start qiv with
      "-w 1"..  but this don't works 100% :-(

  Other:
      Please use "--center, -e" for disabling centering...
            
  ps:  you see the center problem only on the first image..
  pps: if you use FVWM2, WM_HANDLE=0 and --do_grab/-a then you will
       see the window jump again.. the damm WM sucks <g>.. only the
       newest like Enlightenment or Window Mager seems to handle the
       stuff right..  ...but i use still my fvwm2 ;)


Thumbnails:
-----------

  i don't plan on adding a thumbnail function.  sorry, but qiv is a
  QUICK image VIEWER and nothing more.  if you want more features
  (with Imlib) then try Electric Eyes or gqview ...

  
Image caching:
--------------

  if you want image_caching then comment out the
  gdk_imlib_kill_image(im); line in main.c, but don't forget to set
  you cache sizes with imlib_config !  this stuff don't work right
  here (imlib 1.8 cvs) and on a imlib 1.6 system so i have disabled
  this nice Imlib feature by killing the images from the buffer.
