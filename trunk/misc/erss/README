Erss is a RSS feed reader using EFL libs.

INSTALLATION:

./autogen.sh
make
make install

USAGE:
erss -h 
erss -c /usr/local/share/erss/config/osnews.cfg

If you want to set some default settings look at the example 
erssrc file in your data/ dir. Make your changes and 
put it in ~/.erssrc

NOTE:
If the slashdot.cfg is not working try HandyAndE's mirror (handyande.cfg).

For testing you can use the config files named radius.cfg.
(You risk getting banned if you hammer slashdot or any other highvolumesite 
every 5th min for a period of time)

You can find lots of feeds here, just make config files for them:

If you do make a config for a feed and want to share it with us
please e-mail Martin Sarajervi <ms@klmoberg.no>
