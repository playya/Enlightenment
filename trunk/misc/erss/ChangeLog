	* refactoring: remove "cfg" global (per-stream config, now p/o feed)
	* clicking on a tooltip closes it

	* refactoring: remove most global variables (=> Erss_Feed)
	* refactoring: make unecessarily global functions static
	* refactoring: separate data handling from presentation --
	               this may be a Good Thing, but it is also a
	               solid foundation for conditional redraws
	               (don't flicker when there is no new data)
	               and stream aggregation (show ten latest of
	               these five sites (giving 1o, not 5o items))

        * clicking the title (site-name) now takes you to the site
        * <clock> can now also be used in ~/.erssrc; if non-empty,
          it will override the setting in the site-specific config-
          file ("global override")
