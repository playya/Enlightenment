COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

you must then copy engageapplinks to ~/.e/apps/engage/applinks
and engagemappings to ~/.e/apps/engage/mappings

you may wish to edit those two files to your liking

for animations such as a clock create a directory called
~/.e/apps/engage/sysicons and put in this your favourite animations
(try expedition.eet (analog clock) or digital.eet (digital clock) provided in
this directory for a start).
Valid files here are any .eet that has a "Main" part to load.
