COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

you need to make ~/.e/apps/engage/launcher/ and ~/.e/apps/engage/mapping/
use the build_icon.sh script to build icon files to populate the two directories.
These icons are compatible with the upcoming e17 e_app icons with some
modifications agreed with raster.

The launcher directory should have icons placed in it that will always appear
on the bar. the mapping directory should contain icons for mapping application
windows to icons on the bar.

Unmatched windows will pick up the xapp.eet in the shared directory which has
no icon - _unless_ the theme overrides this icon!

Try using the "none" theme to start with and the "gentoo" theme for a nice
effect (both included) use "engage -t gentoo".

for animations such as a clock create a directory called
~/.e/apps/engage/sysicons and put in this your favourite animations
(try expedition.eet (analog clock) or digital.eet (digital clock) provided in
this directory for a start).
Valid files here are any .eet that has a "Main" part to load.
