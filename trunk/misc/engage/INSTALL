COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

You need to use the build_icon.sh script (as the user that will be running
engage, not root!) to build icon files for your apps.
The script will install both the mapping and the launch icon, you may wish to
remove the launch icon and leave just the mapping in place - instructions on
how to do so follow the successful install of an icon using the build script.
These icons are compatible with the upcoming e17 e_app icons with some
modifications agreed with raster.

Unmatched windows will pick up the xapp.eet in the shared directory which has
no icon - _unless_ the theme overrides this icon!

Try using the "none" theme to start with and the "gentoo" theme for a nice
effect (both included) use "engage -t gentoo".

for animations such as a clock create a directory called
~/.e/apps/engage/sysicons and put in this your favourite animations
(try expedition.eet (analog clock) or digital.eet (digital clock) provided in
this directory for a start).
Valid files here are any .eet that has a "Main" part to load.
