Q; Why do I have no icons?
A: You need to create some! - use the provided build_icon.sh to create them and place them in ~/.e/apps/engage/launcher/

Q: Why are my icons question marks?
A: You have no mapping for the running application - use the builc_icon.sh to create the icon and place it in ~/.e/apps/engage/mapping/

Q: How do I know what arguments to use for the build_icon.sh?
A: Easy :
  1) Application title - the text you wish to appear above the icon
  2) Command - the command used to start (or spawn another instance of) the app
     i.e. "mozilla" or "Eterm --borderless"
  3) Window class }
  4) Window name  } If you do not know these values go to the "remember" settings dialog (if using Enlightenment) and read them off the screen
