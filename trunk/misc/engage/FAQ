Q; Why do I have no icons?
A: You need to create some! - use the e_util_eapp_edit application in e17 cvs to create them for you.

Q: Why are my icons question marks?
A: You have no mapping for the running application - you need a .eapp file
that has a matching window class for the icon it represents - try xprop for a
hint as to your windows class.
