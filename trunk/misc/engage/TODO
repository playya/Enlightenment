0.1.0:
Finish callbacks for E_App and handle mappings more memory-efficiently
Properly handle ordering - only works on startup
-i and -I to ignore running apps (only show launch items) and ignore min apps (
  for folk who prefer their own iconbox)
Seperate behaviour edje from iconsets.


Future:
ability to screenshot instead of window icon for minimised apps
a "background cache" when in on top mode stops so many window resizes
different orientations, so it can be used vertically
