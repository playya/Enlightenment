News for the Audio File Library version 0.1.7
Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

The Audio File Library now has a much more robust configuration
procedure, using automake and autoconf.

G.711 mu-law encoding is now available for the NeXT/Sun .snd/.au file
format.

Documentation has been greatly improved but still needs work.  I'd like
to convert it to the SGML DocBook format eventually.

A simple test suite has been included in the test directory.  Type
"make check" at the top level to ascertain that the Audio File Library
builds correctly on your computer.

Also as of version 0.1.6, the Audio File Library is now available under
the LGPL.
