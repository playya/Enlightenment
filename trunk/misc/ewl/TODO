EWL 0.2 TODO
============
- ewlbutton needs to be a subclass of EWlBox, so we can pack a label
  and image into it.
- faster rendering -- rightn ow it rerenders on every EXPOSE -- that's
  slow as hell.
   - this should be moved to evas ASAP (well as soon as it's API is finalised)
- fix layout -- borked badly atm.
- KainX: kainx doesn't like imlib specific drawing api -- he's right.
- db caching -- right now the db shit is reloaded every time a 
  query is made -- could be a lot faster by leaving htem open and
  then flushing later.
- font path and other goodies added to teh state struct.
- database abstraction -- there's no reason we have to be accessing a 
  local db for anything other than the initial preferences database.
  for example, we could load information from a mysql database over
  the network (an interesting scenario).  I think this would be a 
  good use of hte EwlDB API -- just add a type to the db api, then
  extend the class and add callbacks for each of hte basic things (open
  get, put, close, etc).
- server achitecture (boris)
- client/server comms (boris)
   - code is 50% done, need to tidy up, cleaner and commit it
- client/server Protocol
