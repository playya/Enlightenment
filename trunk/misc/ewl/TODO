EWL 0.2 TODO
============
- faster rendering -- rightn ow it rerenders on every EXPOSE -- that's
  slow as hell.
- fix layout -- borked badly atm.
- KainX: kainx doesn't like imlib specific drawing api -- he's right.
- database abstraction -- there's no reason we have to be accessing a 
  local db for anything other than the initial preferences database.
  for example, we could load information from a mysql database over
  the network (an interesting scenario).  I think this would be a 
  good use of hte EwlDB API -- just add a type to the db api, then
  extend the class and add callbacks for each of hte basic things (open
  get, put, close, etc).
