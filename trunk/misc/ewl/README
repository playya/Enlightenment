Introduction
============
EWL (Enlightened Widget Library)  is a themable widget library using
Imlib2, Evas, and ndbm (db2) configuration files.  EWL features a
GTK+-style programming API, but with a more abstract theming interface
(eg greater customization by the user), layered and translucent widgets,
a simple callback-based event-handling API.  Future plans include an
internal lightweight network protocol, a dynamic widget registry (run-
time objects),


Licensing
=========
EWL is licensed under either a BSD style license, or, at your
discretion, under version 2 or higher of the TVEL.  Please see the
