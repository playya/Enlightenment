Requirements

NDBM, Imlib2, and optinoally fam.
...  hardware reqs depend on theme.


Compiling EWL
=============
make (or gmake on systems without GNU Make as the default make).


Creating Personal Preferences
=============================
cd src/; ./create_personal_preferences.sh 
(creates ~/.ewl/preferences.db).


System-Wide Installation
========================
make install (doesn't currently work).  default prefix is /usr/local,
data and themes go into PREFIX/share/ewl/.  Eventually autoconf will
take care of this voodoo magic for me.
