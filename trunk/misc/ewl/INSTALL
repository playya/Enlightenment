Requirements
============
NDBM2, Imlib2, Evas, and optinoally Mesa 3.3 and FAM.  Here's where
you can find each of these libraries:

- NDBM2:    Unknown (part of GDBM?).
- Imlib2:   Enlightenment CVS [*] (snapshots at http://www.rasterman.com/)
- Evas:     Enlightenment CVS [*]
- Mesa 3.3: http://www.mesa3d.org/
- FAM:      ftp://ftp.mandrake.net/pub/mandrake/

[*] Please see http://www.enlightenment.org/cvs.html for CVS checkout
instructions.  At the very least, you'll need the following modules:
imlib2, evas, and ewl.

TODO: ...  hardware reqs depend on theme.


Compiling EWL
=============
./configure;
make; (or gmake on systems without GNU Make as the default make).
make install; (or gmake... see above)
cd src; ./create_user_preferences.sh


Creating Personal Preferences
=============================
cd src/; ./create_user_preferences.sh 
(creates ~/.ewl/preferences.db).


System-Wide Installation
========================
make install (doesn't currently work).  default prefix is /usr/local,
data and themes go into PREFIX/share/ewl/.  Eventually autoconf will
take care of this voodoo magic for me.
