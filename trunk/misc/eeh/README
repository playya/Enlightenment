EEH!: A simple (pure) EFL replacement for FEH.
----------------------------------------------

EEH is a really simple replacement for FEH.  For years now 
I've used FEH to quickly browse images, in particular images 
taken on my digital camera.  My old camera only took images 
as large as 1600x1200, which is my screen resolution, so viewing was 
no problem.  However my new cam take massive pics that are 
beyond 3000 pixels wide.  FEH's resize capabilties are... not so great.
So, EEH is ment to simply replace feh for this purpose: You wanna see
a bunch of images and you want them to resize to some fixed size
thats smaller that your desktop.  Bing, bang, simple.

Future additions will likely include image metadata display 
(optionally, probly by whacking a keybind to toggle it on and off)
to view filename, size, and any interesting EXIF data.
