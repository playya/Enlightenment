Things that are not quite finished yet:
* Caching System - right now the cache infinitely bloats :)  this is not good.
* portability issues - I think I took care of all the real portability issues
(endianness, etc) but I have to do some real pounding to see how it goes on my
systems at home
* file locking.  I need to work on the  locking mechanisms for the system.  I
need multiple instances to not pound everything as everyone is reading data.
* test applications - I need to write some little apps that test out all of
this stuff - testapp only tests the paths stuff right now.
