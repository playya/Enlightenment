revamped the test app.  it now shows off quite a few different bits.
There's a minor bug in either the appendtofattable code or in the key
returning code.  I will figure that out in a little bit.  the fat/data list is
x86 dependant until I redo the data format ever-so-slightly.  But eConfig is
probably good enough at this point to start building minor apps with.  expect
there to be some more convenience wrappers shortly.
