COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

NOTE: You MUST make install Eclips for it to run properly.

make install currently does not copy the data/ dir.
to fix this:

cp -rf data PREFIX/share/eclips/
chmod 0755 PREFIX/share/eclips/data
chmod 0644 PREFIX/share/eclips/data/*
