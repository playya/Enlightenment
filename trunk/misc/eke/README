Eke
===

Introduction
------------
Eke is an attempt at a RSS feed aggregator. The UIs are in no way complete
at the moment. The EWL UI can handle multiple feeds, the Edje one currenlty
has no way to load the multiple feeds.

Compiling & Installing
----------------------
You need a lot of stuff to make Eke work. Thats cuz I'm lazy and want to use
what other people have written. You'll need at least the following:

- Evas
- Edje
- Ecore
- EWL
- Esmart
- libxml2
- OpenSSL libraries

To compile:
> ./autogen.sh
> make
> su -c 'make install'

Usage
-----
The easiest way to get going is to just run:
./eke

This will take you into the EWL gui wihtout any feeds loaded. You can then
use the feeds menu item to load up some feeds.

If you want the edje gui, do:
./eke --gui-edje http://www.server.com/path/to/feed

and it should load it up. If you want to use the Edje gui then you need to
do the 'make install' step above.

Eke tries to be smart with its loading of the feeds. Each feed will be
cached in ~/.e/apps/eke/cache. Eke will then check this cache file if its
restarted to see if its timeout has expired (currently 5 minutes). If Eke
needs to retrieve a new feed it will store a SHA1 hash of the feed contents,
then when it is retrived again it will compare the SHA1 hashes, if they are
matched no change will take place, else the UI will update.
