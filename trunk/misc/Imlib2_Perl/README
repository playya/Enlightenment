To render on Gtk drawables, you must patch Gtk::Perl until the patch I sent
gets in Gtk::Perl official distribution to do so
get http://www.muhri.net/pronto/gnome-perl.tar.gz
untar gnome-perl.tar.gz
cd gnome-perl/Gtk/xs
cat gtk-perl-patch | patch

then compile Gtk::Perl and you'll ahve the changes and the examples should
work ...
