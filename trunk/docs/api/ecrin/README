Ecrin
-----

Ecrin is a devhelp-like tool (http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Devhelp).
It reads the xml output generated by doxygen, and try to display all
the enums, defines and functions that are documented in the API.

There is also a small search tool to help in finding what you want in
big api.

It currently works well with eet and ecore. I've not tested it with
other efl.

Requirement:
------------

 * Ecore
 * Ewl
 * libxml2

You need to generate the xml output of the efl (change Doxyfile, run
gendoc and run the combine xsl script to get a file with all the
documentation).

Usage:
------

Just type 'ecrin xml_file' after having installed it. Usually,
xml_file is all.xml, obtained with the xsl script combine.xsl.

Run ecrin -h to see the (useless) option.

If you want to use the search, you have to press the Enter key
in the entry to select the enums/defines/functions.
