Thanks to the tireless efforts of Ravenlock we've been accepted into the
Google Summer of Code program.  This is a great step for Enlightenment and
will hopefully bring in some fresh blood in to the project.</p>

<p>
If you're interested in doing a project for E you should start poking around
the mailing lists, wiki, bugtracker and IRC. Showing some interest before
the application project goes a long way to showing us that you'll be able to
do your project.</p>

<p>
Thanks again Ravenlock and good work.
