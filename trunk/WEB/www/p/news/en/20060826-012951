E17 Status Update

<p>Contrary to the amount of updates this page has seen recently, 
the Enlightenment developers have been very hard at work.  E17 is coming along nicely
and shaping up to be the clean, speedy and solid desktop shell that we've all been hoping for.
The best way to track activity on the project is definitely via CVS commits.
There are various options for tracking commits, namely the commit mailing list , 
the CIA page, also the edevelop.org feeds include CIA.   Another good way to get a birds-eye view
of the project is the TODO file, for e17 especially, this file is updated very frequently and contains
lots of interesting tidbits, here's an overview of the significant TODO items:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The integrated file-selector in e17 has seen recent work, in order to provide desktop file icons, it will probably be getting .desktop support.</li>
 <li>Drag-and-Drop improvements needed for iBar, desktop and the file selector.  This will likely include an easy way to drag from a pool of available applications.</li>
 <li>Language packs: There needs to be a tool to load/setup language packs (and an optional font and a config file that specifies the locale and font).</li>
 <li>CPU Load and "taskbar" modules need to be added to the core e17 modules.  A candidate for these have already been added to the e_modules CVS repository, they likely just need to be cleaned up, get theme updates, and be blessed by rasterman.</li>
 <li>Color classes for themes need to be easily configurable via Configuration dialogs.  This allows a theme designed to support color classes have dynamically colored components!</li>
 <li>Finish off standards compliancy for ICCCM and NETWM.</li>
 <li>Finish creating configuration dialogs for configuration options.</li>
 <li>Various improvements for Border and Border Icon functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these there are several bugs and "Nice to have" features that are also being worked on.
Take a closer look at the TODO file if you're interested and as always we encourage anyone to contribute!
Send any patches to the development mailing list in unified diff format (diff -u) as attachments and join
us on IRC via irc.freenode.net in #e and #edevelop.  We are excited about E17's progress and hope to reach
"beta" state sometime soon.  With any luck we'll be Duke Nuke'em out the door!</p>
