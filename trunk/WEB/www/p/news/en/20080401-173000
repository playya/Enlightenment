An Alpha release candidate for Eet 1.0.0 (Alpha version 0.9.99900) is now
available for testing and evaluation. Please see the
<?php a("about/efl/eet", "Eet");?> about page for download links and

<p>
This Alpha release is a candidate for a 1.0.0 full release of Eet. We ask
that all people test it, the builds, configure checks and anything else. We
believe this to be of release quality and if testing does not find any
issues, a 1.0.0 release will follow. Packagers from distributions may check
that builds work and report anything back to us that is needed to make it
easier or more correct to package.
