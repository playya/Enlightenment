<h1>Contributing</h1>

<p>If you're looking to help out on the project you're in the right place.
We are always looking for people to work on code, do translations, write
documentation, help new users, answer forum questions or verify bugs. If
this kind of thing peaks your interest keep reading.</p>

<p>All of the Enlightenment development happens out of the CVS repositories.
You can browse the repository through the <a href="http://enlightenment.org/viewvc">ViewVC</a> interface.
You can work off of the snapshots but you'll always be behind the current
set of patches and fixes that are in CVS. Any bugs being report should be
done against the latest CVS revisions.</p>

<p>Anonymous checkouts of any CVS module can be done with the following command:
 <pre>
  cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.enlightenment.org:/var/cvs/e co <b>MODULE</b>
 </pre>
</p>

<p>There are several modules in CVS - each for different purposes. Below is a
description of these modules and their uses:</p>

<p>
 <center>
  <table class='tab'>
   <tr>
    <th class='tab'>MODULE</th>
    <th class='tab'>DESCRIPTION</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class='tab1'>e17</td>
    <td class='tab1'>This is where all the code for E17 and its libraries lives</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class='tab2'>e16</td>
    <td class='tab2'>This is where e16's code lives</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class='tab1'>misc</td>
    <td class='tab1'>This contains miscellaneous tools and programs</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class='tab2'>web</td>
    <td class='tab2'>This is where this website is stored</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class='tab1'>devs</td>
    <td class='tab1'>This is information on all developers and this governs their CVS access</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class='tab2'>eterm</td>
    <td class='tab2'>This is the Eterm repository</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 </center>
</p>

<p>If you're granted access to the developer CVS repository you'll use a different mechanism to
checkout the source code. Once you've provided your SSH key and your account is setup you'll do the following:</p>

<p>
 <pre>
  export CVS_RSH=ssh
  cvs -z3 -d <b>USERNAME</b>@cvs.enlightenment.org:/cvs/e co <b>MODULE</b>
 </pre>
</p>

href="http://docs.enlightenment.org">documentation</a>. Any bugs identified,
or features desired, can be entered into the <a
