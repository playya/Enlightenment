ecore (0.9.9.050+svn20081201-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upstream SVN snapshot
    - Packages renamed due to API changes
      + libecore-dev->libecore-0.9.9.050a-dev, libecore0->libecore-0.9.9.050a
    - Add debian/patches/{01-fix-library-soname,02-reapply-autofoo}: Use release
      instead of version-info to create libecore0 SONAME, to prevent things
      from breaking when the ABI changes again. This only affects libecore, not
      the other libraries.
    - Remove the symbols file for libecore0 as it it's almost useless now
    - build-depend and make libecore-0.9.9.050a-dev depend on libeina-0.0.1a-dev
    - update libecore-{con,evas}0.symbols
  * [lintian] Add ${misc:Depends} to package dependencies

    - B-D on dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.8) as we're using symbols files support
  * CFLAGS += -fvisibility=hidden to avoid exporting private symbols
