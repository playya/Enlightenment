Etk version 0.02
================

These are the Etk bindings for the Enlightenment Toolkit (etk)
This version is a direct almost 1-to-1 mapping of the C function
calls into a Perl OO interface.

In order to find out how the functions map, you need to remove
the namespace from the function, ex:

The C function call:  etk_window_title_set(window, title);
translates into: $window->title_set($title);
where $window is an object of type Etk::Window

Alternatively, there is another calling technique which
removes underscores and uppercases the first letter of 
each word: $window->TitleSet($title);

This calling technique is for now converted with a regular 
expression into the real function call, so it has its problems.
