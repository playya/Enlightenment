TODO:
	- callback system needs to convert event structs to perl equivalents 
	- port evas key modifiers and locks
	- perldoc everything
	- complete Tests
	- Check for memory usage (I'm not sure if we're leaking or not,
	  need to do some tests for that)
	- Fix Combobox append functions (waiting for some functionality in etk)

BUGS:
	- make test is defining PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 for some reason and
	  fails to load the library, for now you can run:
	  $ perl -MExtUtils::Command::MM -e "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Etk/*.t

Pending:
	-etk_canvas.h
	-dnd
