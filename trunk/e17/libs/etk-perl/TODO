TODO:
	- callback system needs to convert event structs to perl equivalents 
	- port evas key modifiers and locks
	- perldoc everything
	- complete Tests
	- Check for memory usage (I'm not sure if we're leaking or not,
	  need to do some tests for that)
	- Add cache for perl objects which will help keep track of the C objects
	- Fix Combobox append functions (waiting for some functionality in etk)

BUGS:
	- make test is defining PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 for some reason and
	  fails to load the library, for now you can run:
	  $ perl -MExtUtils::Command::MM -e "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Etk/*.t

	- some methods return Etk::Widget, there's no way to know
	  what the original type of the object was, and the object
	  is unusable most of the time unless you bless it into its
	  original package. (The cache in the TODO above will help solve this)

Pending:
	-etk_canvas.h
