Description: 
  Evas is an advanced canvas library, providing three backends for
  rendering: X11 (without some features like alpha-blending), imlib2, or
  OpenGL (hardware accelerated). Due to its simple API, evas can be
  developed with rapidly, and cleanly.
  Install evas if you want to develop applications against the only
  hardware-accelerated canvas library, or if you want to try out the
  applications under development.
