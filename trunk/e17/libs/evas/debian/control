Description: enlightenment advanced canvas library development files
 This package provides headers and static libraries required to develop against
 evas.
 .
 Evas is an advanced canvas library, providing six engines for rendering: X11,
 OpenGL (hardware accelerated), DirectFB, the framebuffer, Microsoft Windows
 and Qtopia.
 .
 This new version of evas is much more cleaner, compact and portable; and has
 Ipaq support. The Ipaq version of the library is just 191Kb in size!
 .
 Due to its simple API, evas can be developed with rapidly, and cleanly.
 Install evas if you want to develop applications against the only
 hardware-accelerated canvas library, or if you want to try out the
 applications under development.
