COMPILING and INSTALLING:

please see the README file.

NB: you will need pkgconfig package (available for debian and for redhat -
try www.rpmfind.net if you're lost, or go to the pkgconfig website:
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/ ) if your are taking this from 
CVS and having to run ./autogen.sh)

NOTE: for compilation with MinGW, fnmatch.h is probably missing.
      That file can be found here:

      It should be installed in the mingw include directory.

NOTE: for the OpenGL engine on Windows, the glew library:
http://glew.sourceforge.net/
      is needed.
