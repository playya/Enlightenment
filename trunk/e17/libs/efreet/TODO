TODO
----
- Efreet_Menu should setup an Ecore_File_Monitor on the .menu files and the
  app_dir and reload the menu when needed

- .desktop saving

- We need a better system to distinguish between when a user wants to create a
  new .desktop file and when he wants to parse an existing file.

- The move handling is wrong when moving to a destination with /'s in the
  name. We should be creating intermediate menus for each of the /'d items
  instead of just making the name as we do now

- Need to store a pure exec for the .desktop files we can match on.

- Need to monitor default application directories so we can update the cache if
  a .desktop file is added or removed.

- Add support for searching for a list of fallback icons in the current theme
  BEFORE looking in the inherited themes (e.g. for mime-types that go from
  specific to general).

- We need to update the cache in efreet. Now it will overwrite user .desktop
  files with system .desktop files, as the system files are found later.

- When files are added by the monitor, check if the file should be preferred
  over one existing (if the user adds a file in the home dir it should be
  preferred over one in the system dir).

- When adding a new dir for monitoring, scan the dir first as it might have files
  before we register a monitor

Notes from the Menu Spec test
-----------------------------
- We're appending the / to the menu names in the test case. We should
  possibly be doing that in the efreet code itself.
