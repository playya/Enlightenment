TODO
----
- Efreet_Menu should setup an Ecore_File_Monitor on the .menu files and the
  app_dir and reload the menu when needed

- .desktop saving

- We need a better system to distinguish between when a user wants to create a
  new .desktop file and when he wants to parse an existing file.

- The move handling is wrong when moving to a destination with /'s in the
  name. We should be creating intermediate menus for each of the /'d items
  instead of just making the name as we do now

- Add caching for faster lookup. The caches should be filled by an idler
  - file-id for .desktop files from default app dirs.
  - startup_wm_class

- Add support for searching for a list of fallback icons in the current theme BEFORE looking in the inherited themes (e.g. for mime-types that go from specific to general).

Notes from the Menu Spec test
-----------------------------
- We're appending the / to the menu names in the test case. We should
  possibly be doing that in the efreet code itself.
