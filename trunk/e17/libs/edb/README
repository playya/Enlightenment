This is a database conveneince library base on db 2.7.7 from
http://www.sleepycat.com (see src/LICENSE for license details). It is 
intended to make accessing database information portable, easy, fast and 
efficient as well as bypass the proplem of libdb continuously changing
formats. Read the Edb.h header for inormation on how to use the calls and the 
test directory for sample code.

COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure

( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )

Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

Voila.
You now have a E's db convenience wrapper library installed. It is hoped
this will prove useful to you. If you find any bugs please report them to the
authors (listed in the AUTHORS file).
