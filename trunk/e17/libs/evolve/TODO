TODO:

- respect property types (read / write etc) in prop dialogs
- evolve: did we add scrolled_view widget everywhere?
- evolve builder widget cut / paste
- evolve builder widget deletion
- evolve builder eet writeout
- evolve builder property dialogs for all widgets
- widgets (packing): menus, iconbox, shadow, combobox
- can we make signals / callbacks easier to handle? (remove callback name from
  .etk file? emit a signal instead a la edje?) maybe use on_signalname {} ?
- handle if a widget needs another widget (example, radio buttons, menus etc)
- now that we sort the widgets, we need a way to preserve order somehow
- signal internal data support should check for variables and functions for
  type = variable (perhaps add type = function?)
- implement "-i" flag for multiple image directories

DONE:

+ bundle images used by internal image objects into the eet
+ implement structure for packing options to reduce code (used evas_hash)
+ sort widget list for less walks during runtime
+ think of a way to make evolve write out an edje with "/etk/" keys
+ allow evolve widgets to set custom .edj files for their themes
+ redo render code so we only walk through list once
+ allow evolve widgets to overrider etk's default packing method (swallows)
+ make sure a property exists before setting it (compile time error)
