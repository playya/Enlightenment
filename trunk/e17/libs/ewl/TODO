EWL TODO
========

- Ewl_Entry 
    - Multiline edit (in progress).
      - This requires some re-working of the evas_object_textblock as there
        are currently some issues with the interaction.
    - Text wrap fixups.
    - Need to make the text scroll over as you type past the end of the entry box.
    - when you remove all text from an entry its size becomes quite small.
- Tree selection mode set and themeing (MULTI/SINGLE/EXTENDED/NONE).
	- Invert on mouse click (behavior depends upon select mode).
	- determination of whether a row is selected or not (ewl_[tree_]row_selected).

- Enabled/Disabled status for ALL applicable widgets.

- Need to return a context when items are pushed onto the status bar so that
  a context can be removed without popping off the stack

- [BUG] Fix Box cutoff of elements with padding/insets (?) > 0.
- [BUG] Fix left padding of the radio button.
- [BUG] Fix size of the seeker.
- [BUG] The Ewl_Paned widget dosen't allow resizing to the right. One way
        only at the moment.
- [BUG] Radio buttons seem to get padded in a bit more then they should.
        Look at the 'Button' test for an example.
- [BUG] Default theme when using the imenu/menu the submenu dosen't highlight on
        mouse over.
- [BUG] When using the menu clicking on the label a second time dosen't
        close the menu.
- [BUG] Spinner seems to resize itself slightly larger even when it dosen't
        have too.
- [BUG] The arrows for the spinner need to be smaller.
- [BUG] Colour selector is very messedup.
- [BUG] The table test dosen't look correct...
- [BUG] The ewl_test seems to get a small gap between the right edje of the
        test and the trough for the scrollbar. Should be flush.
        - The 'Password' test seems to make this gap grow.
- [BUG] The first time a tooltip popps up in the ewl_test (tooltip test) it
        appears over the button, instead of off the end of the mouse. Subsequent
        activations are in the correct spot
