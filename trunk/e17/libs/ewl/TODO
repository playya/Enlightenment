EWL TODO
========

- Ewl_Entry 
    - Text wrap fixups.
    - Need to make the text scroll over as you type past the end of the entry box.

- Tree selection mode set and themeing (MULTI/SINGLE/EXTENDED/NONE).
	- Invert on mouse click (behavior depends upon select mode).
	- determination of whether a row is selected or not (ewl_[tree_]row_selected).

- ColorChooser needs a slider for choosing alpha too, and an int a parameter for
  get / set to match

- Enabled/Disabled status for ALL applicable widgets.

- Need to return a context when items are pushed onto the status bar so that
  a context can be removed without popping off the stack

- all the themes need to be gone over, cleaned up and corrected.

- [BUG] Fix size of the seeker.
- [BUG] The Ewl_Paned widget dosen't allow resizing to the right. One way
        only at the moment.
- [BUG] Default theme when using the imenu/menu the submenu dosen't highlight on
        mouse over.
- [BUG] When using the menu clicking on the label a second time dosen't
        close the menu.
- [BUG] Spinner seems to resize itself slightly larger even when it dosen't
        have too.
- [BUG] The arrows for the spinner need to be smaller.
- [BUG] The arrows for the spinner need to appear on e17 & zero theme
- [BUG] The ewl_test seems to get a small gap between the right edje of the
        test and the trough for the scrollbar. Should be flush.
        - The 'Password' test seems to make this gap grow.
- [BUG] The first time a tooltip pops up in the ewl_test (tooltip test) it
        appears over the button, instead of off the end of the mouse. Subsequent
        activations are in the correct spot
- [BUG] Dialog text bounds are not considered when packing the window
- [BUG] Grid and Table layouts do not pack or resize correctly

- Need to do some work on the tree.
  - add ability to wrap text in tree nodes
  - add ability to clear all rows under a parent row
  - add ability to set row to expand when item clicked (ie
    ewl_tree_row_expand_on_click_set())
  - horizontal scrolling is wacked
  - add ability to turn highlight off for certain rows/nodes
  - scrollbar dosen't always appear when expected using the tree
  - if you have the tree so it has the scroll bar appear, if you're at the
    bottom of the scrollarea and you expand a row, the text shoudln't shift
    up. The scrollpane should be adjusted so the line you expanded stays
    where it is and everything shifts down.
