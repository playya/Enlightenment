EWL BUGS
========

- Scrollbar jumps when trying to drag the button from its lower part

- Default theme when using the imenu/menu the submenu dosen't highlight on
  mouse over.

- The ewl_test seems to get a small gap between the right edje of the
  test and the trough for the scrollbar. Should be flush.
    - The 'Password' test seems to make this gap grow.

- Dialog text bounds are not considered when packing the window

- Grid and Table layouts do not pack or resize correctly. The child show
  and resize callbacks do not set the preferred inner size, this is 
  necessary for correct initial size. Their logic is just plain wrong 
  right now.

- Seem to have lost the .. entry in the filedialog files list.
  ecore_file_ls filters this out.

- In ewl_text if your in a multiline text and on a line that is longer
  then then one above or below and you hit the up arrow it will
  position your cursor one character _before_ the end of the line.

- In ewl_text if your in a multiline text and on the last line
  of multiple lines. Pressing arrow down can wrap to the beginning
  of the first line.

- The ewl_password entry needs to correctly deal with selections and
  mouse clicks.

- Buttons don't correctly react to a keypress. Currently just a
  printf, should actually trigger the button pressed callback

- Widgets need a focused state in the edje so we can know where the focus is

- Radio and check buttons should react to key presses and toggle as needed

- How to deal with the scrollpane with the focus? Currently widgets
  marked INTERNAL are ignored on the inital add. Should the scrollpane 
  find itself in the tab list on SHOW and substitue the seekers instead?

- Menus will activate on tab, but it jumps to the submenu instead of
  each menu item

- If you run ewl_test and select a test the main window will have the
  tests code filled in. The scrollpane ends up being twice as big as
  it should be.

- The text widget dosen't handle the wrap flag correctly.

- The Ewl_Menu dosen't work correclty anymore. Once the menu is opened, 
  as soon as the mouse moves the menu is closed again. (Possibly due to
  the embed changing the focused widget?)

- Tooltips and dialogs aren't friends. If you don't set the active area
  correctly the tooltip will go to the current active area. If you set 
  the active area, the tooltip dosen't seem to appear.


  Ewl_Icon bugs/todo
  ------------------
 - Need to add the constrain stuff in like iconbox does at the moment.
   Figure out the constrain size by first checking the max size of the widget
   and falling back to check /icon/constrain/size from the theme, then
   falling back to a default 64 if no theme value set
 
 - Clicking on the label 'Draw (Editable)' then clicking again will case a
   warning to print. I _think_ the move event is getting fired for the text
   widget after I've deleted it in the ewl_icon code. Need to confirm/fix
   this.
 
 - Need to properly center the icon and the text in the icon widget
 
 - Menus aren't hooked up. This should popup on right click and hide on a
   click outside the menu. Needs to do all that grabby stuff menus do (which
   should be in the menu's already.
 
 - Should change label editing to double click on the icon instead of
   clicking on the label itself.
 
 - Need to hook up label compressing (adding ... after a certain size)
   similar to what iconbox is currently doing.

 - Should Ewl_Icon be doing thumbnailing or assume it is getting passed
   thumbnails? Does it need a second api added? ewl_icon_image_thumb_add
   which will create the thumb?


EWL TODO
========
- Ability to attach arbitrary cursors to each widget. Attachment portion done,
  need to add cursor code.

- In ewl_init should options be parsed after loading config values from
  ecore_config. ewl_init_parse_options() vs. ewl_config_init()

- fix mismatch between use_engine in ewl_init() and ewl_config.evas.render_method 

- Ewl_Entry 
    - Need to make the text scroll over as you type past the end of the entry box.

- ColorChooser needs a slider for choosing alpha too, and an int a parameter for
  get / set to match [I'm handling this -- dj2]

- Enabled/Disabled status for ALL applicable widgets.

- Need to return a context when items are pushed onto the status bar so that
  a context can be removed without popping off the stack

- The placement of the tooltips needs to be smarter. Currently it just
  places off of the right bottom, but that should be adjusted depending on
  where we are relative to the window border

- Multi-select file dialog needs to highlight selections and append
  filenames in the text field.

- Need to do some work on the tree.
  - add ability to wrap text in tree nodes
  - add ability to clear all rows under a parent row
  - add ability to set row to expand when item clicked (ie
    ewl_tree_row_expand_on_click_set())
  - horizontal scrolling is wacked
  - add ability to turn highlight off for certain rows/nodes
  - scrollbar dosen't always appear when expected using the tree
  - if you have the tree so it has the scroll bar appear, if you're at the
    bottom of the scrollarea and you expand a row, the text shoudln't shift
    up. The scrollpane should be adjusted so the line you expanded stays
    where it is and everything shifts down.

- Tree selection mode set and themeing (MULTI/SINGLE/EXTENDED/NONE).
  - Invert on mouse click (behavior depends upon select mode).
  - determination of whether a row is selected or not (ewl_[tree_]row_selected).
