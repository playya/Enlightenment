EWL TODO
========

- [BUG] Entry can trigger a series of selection create/destroys when clicking
        on the end of the text.
- [BUG] Scrollbar jumps when trying to drag the button from its lower part
- [BUG] The Ewl_Paned widget dosen't allow resizing to the right. One way
        only at the moment.
	(This isn't true - see Entropy)
- [BUG] Default theme when using the imenu/menu the submenu dosen't highlight on
        mouse over.
- [BUG] Spinner seems to resize itself slightly larger even when it dosen't
        have too.
- [BUG] The ewl_test seems to get a small gap between the right edje of the
        test and the trough for the scrollbar. Should be flush.
        - The 'Password' test seems to make this gap grow.
- [BUG] Dialog text bounds are not considered when packing the window
- [BUG] Grid and Table layouts do not pack or resize correctly. The child show
        and resize callbacks do not set the preferred inner size, this is 
	necessary for correct initial size. Their logic is just plain wrong 
	right now.
- [BUG] Seem to have lost the .. entry in the filedialog files list.
        Something wrong with the regex's or caused by something in
	ecore_file

- Ability to attach arbitrary cursors to each widget. Attachment portion done,
  need to add cursor code.

- In ewl_init should options be parsed after loading config values from
  ecore_config. ewl_init_parse_options() vs. ewl_config_init()

- fix mismatch between use_engine in ewl_init() and ewl_config.evas.render_method 

- Ewl_Entry 
    - Text wrap fixups.
    - Need to make the text scroll over as you type past the end of the entry box.

- ColorChooser needs a slider for choosing alpha too, and an int a parameter for
  get / set to match [I'm handling this -- dj2]

- Enabled/Disabled status for ALL applicable widgets.

- Need to return a context when items are pushed onto the status bar so that
  a context can be removed without popping off the stack

- The placement of the tooltips needs to be smarter. Currently it just
  places off of the right bottom, but that should be adjusted depending on
  where we are relative to the window border

- Multi-select file dialog needs to highlight selections and append
  filenames in the text field.

- Need to do some work on the tree.
  - add ability to wrap text in tree nodes
  - add ability to clear all rows under a parent row
  - add ability to set row to expand when item clicked (ie
    ewl_tree_row_expand_on_click_set())
  - horizontal scrolling is wacked
  - add ability to turn highlight off for certain rows/nodes
  - scrollbar dosen't always appear when expected using the tree
  - if you have the tree so it has the scroll bar appear, if you're at the
    bottom of the scrollarea and you expand a row, the text shoudln't shift
    up. The scrollpane should be adjusted so the line you expanded stays
    where it is and everything shifts down.

- Tree selection mode set and themeing (MULTI/SINGLE/EXTENDED/NONE).
  - Invert on mouse click (behavior depends upon select mode).
  - determination of whether a row is selected or not (ewl_[tree_]row_selected).
