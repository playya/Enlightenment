/* 
 * Make ewl_tree2 an ewl_box. it will pack in the paned header and a
 * ewl_tree_display widget for the body. This will be a standard vbox. 
 *
 * subclassing widgets (ewl_tree_scrolled) will inherit tree and can then
 * pull the _display widget out of the main box, pack in their scrollpane
 * and then pack the _display widget back into the box. 
 *
 * This means that all the standard tree calls will work on the subclassing
 * stuff, as the tree will do the work, and the subclassers will just move
 * the shit in the tree around as needed.
 *
 * Ewl_Widget *rows needs to be a custom widget that can lay the widgets out
 * in their tree view.
 *
 * Cons
 * ----
 * Needs an extra widget to hold the 'display' of the tree data
 *
 *
 * The _display will actually be called ewl_tree2_view. This will be
 * abstracted out like the filelist does for the filedialog. This way we can
 * have different types of 'views' on the tree columns. So, there would be
 * the default view which is just as now (ewl_tree2_view_tree) and if
 * someone wanted they could write ewl_tree2_view_spreadsheet to get a more
 * spreadsheet type view with numbers down the side and letters over the
 * top.

/**
 * @addtogroup Ewl_Tree2 Ewl_Tree2: A Widget for List or Tree Layout
 * @brief Defines a widget for laying out other widgets in a tree or list
 * like manner. This also fulfills the functionality often seen in a table
 * widget.
 *
 * Model:
 * Defines communication callbacks for views and controllers. Query row/column
 * data, indicate expansion points, notify views and controllers of changes,
 * trigger sorting on a row/column combination.
 *
 * Data:
 * Provides a wrapper to the data which allows for observer registration and a
 * reference to a model for data access.
 *
 * View:
 * Defines the callbacks for setting up the widgets based on the data returned
 * from the Model. Create widgets, set data on widgets, calculate sizing,
 * minimize number of widgets.
 *
 * Controller:
 * The tree defines the entire controller and registers with the model.
 * Provides controls to sort columns, expand/collapse branching points, reacts
 * to changes from data model.
 *
 * Simple case:
 * Widgets packed using standard container functions. This should result in a
 * simple list of packed widgets.
 *
 * Features:
 * * Default data provider, so standard container functions are supported.
 * * MVC pattern of data access for more powerful layouts.
 * * Packing of arbitrary widget types in cells.
 * * Theming based on repeating row counts.
 * * Number of columns dependant on number of providers, not a fixed number.
 * * When using data providers, can reap widgets to save memory and decrease
 *   layout time.
 *
 * Issues:
 * * How do we support click callbacks on full rows? Special notifier
 *   necessary? Proposal: Tree value change callback on row selection. Passes
 *   event structure with array of selected row numbers. Simple case handled
 *   by callback on packed widgets.
 * * Column or row layout? Column allows for redirecting to a container to
 *   handle the case of container functions used to add widgets and to use a
 *   fixed number of rows in display region. It would also allow for skipping
 *   configure of an entire off-screen column, rows would lay out the cells
 *   off-screen. How do we implement column layout? Proposal: Row height
 *   cache, easy for fixed height rows, more complex for variable height.
