 EWL is the Enlightenment Widget Library written with evas, ecore, ebits, ewd,
 etox and edb to achieve maximum prestanda.
 Why another widget lib you ask your self? Well we wanted the special look for
 Enlightenment 17. There are millions of widget set's out there, but noone that
 can do alpha blending, and this is a poor shame, without alpha blending
 you aren't able to have all this cool special FX that EWL will have.
 Now you ask yourself why not change a current widget set to use evas instead?
 Well for starters it is REALLY REALLY hard to rewrite the gfx engine in a
 widget set, its nearly impossible, so thats why we write a whole new widget set
