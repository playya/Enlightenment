 * The Ewl_Button includes an icon and label by default but is actually a full
 * container that can hold any type of non-toplevel widget. Because of this
 * flexibility many other widget types inherit from the button.
 *
 * @code
 * Ewl_Widget *button;
 * button = ewl_button_new();
 * ewl_button_label_set(EWL_BUTTON(button), "Button label");
 * ewl_widget_show(button);
 * @endcode
