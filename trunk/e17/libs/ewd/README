What is Ecore? It is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction
layer that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops,
timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimised, and convenient. it's a separate
librayr so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job
easy for applications.
