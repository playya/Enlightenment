Everything

- edje can take boolean values as:
      true/false, 0/1, on/off
  need to support this in engrave

- need to write all of the corresponding _get methods and port engrave_out
  to use those methods.

- put an editable canvas into engrave as an Evas_Object such that any
  program can use it to make an editor???
