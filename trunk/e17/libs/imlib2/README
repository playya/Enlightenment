This is the Imlib 2 library - a library that does image file loading and
saving as well as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support, etc.

It does ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly
intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done
easily, without sacrificing speed.

This is a complete rewrite over the Imlib 1.x series. The architecture is
more modular, simple, and flexible. See index.html in the doc/ directory
for more information.

Imlib2 requires several libraries to be already installed. These are:

edb              ftp://ftp.enlightenment.org/pub/e/e17/libs/
libjpeg          http://www.ijg.org/
libpng           http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
freetype 1.2     http://www.freetype.org/


For examples of this library in use, seek:

Eterm            http://www.eterm.org/ (CVS version only, currently)
