This is the Imlib 2 library - a library that does load file loading and saving
as well as rendering, manipulation etc. It also does ALL of these FAST and
tries to be highly intelligent about doing it to make writing niaeve programs
that are still very fast.

This is an early stage of its release and thus is Imlib2 0.0.1 - there are
bugs that have to be worked out - primarily ones that might deal with network
rendering, endianess and the lack of loaders.

The src/ directory contains the Imlib2 source itself
The loaders/ directory contains some sample loaders and savers (a loader both
loads and saves a certain format)
The test/ directory contains a test program you can compiel and run after
Imlib2 is installed (runt he test program in the test directory)
The libltdl/ direcotry contains the LGPL licensed source for libtool to enable
loadable module support on all platforms.
