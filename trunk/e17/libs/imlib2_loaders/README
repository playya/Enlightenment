This package contains image loader plugins for Imlib 2 that are not distributed
together with the Imlib 2 package itself. More about Imlib 2 can be found on
http://www.rasterman.com/imlib.html.

Currently the only loader contained is an XCF loader, which cannot be packaged
together with Imlib 2 because Imlib 2 is distributed under the BSD license,
whereas the XCF loader is using elements of the Gimp's (www.gimp.org) codebase,
which is distributed under the GPL.

To install, apply the usual ./configure <options>; make; make install sequence.


                                                     Have fun,
                                                       --cK.
