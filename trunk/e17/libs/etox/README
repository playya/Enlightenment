Etox - An evas based text layout library
----------------------------------------

Etox provides facilities for multi-line text layout, as well as obstacle
wrapping and text stylization.

Todo:
+ etox_free
+ obstacle wrapping
+ region selection
+ columnar layout

Progress:
+ Index selection now gets the correct bits, need to generalize the update
  mechanism to allow updating all lists when splitting a bit, including when
  splitting around obstacles.
+ Also need to write generalized code to wrap/rewrap the lines when bit
  splitting has occurred.

Optimizations
-------------
+ REDUCE LIST TRAVERSING
+ Inline (un)wrapping with layout to enable a single list traversal
