--------------------
[Bugs to fix (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* Fix a bug in etk_tree: when you've scrolled to the end of the left tree in etk_test, and if you
maximized the window, the tree is not correctly updated (maybe a bug in etk_scrolled_view)
* Check if all the widgets can be reparented on a different window (i.e. unrealized then re-realized)
without causing any problem
* Check if all the functions of all the widgets work even is the widget is not realized
(i.e. attached to a window)
* etk_window_resize() does not work correctly
* etk_paned_position_set() does not work if the paned is not realized
* Fix the focus problems in the notebook (you can focus children which are on an invisible page)
* Sometimes the window of a menu is not hidden when the menu is popped_down
* The labels sometimes does not returns its ideal size requisition (happens when there is a <br>)
Maybe a bug of the evas textblock
* Fix and optimize the colorpicker
* Sometimes, the mouse cursor is not reset when you stop resizing a row in the tree

--------------------
[Things that need to be improved (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* Improve the entry: add selection supports, better keyboard navigation [In progress: MoOm]
* Add a cache system to cache images used by the tree and the future iconbox in order to make
the scrolling smoother [In progress: MoOm]
* Allow the theme to change the color/font/style of the labels
* More API work for the tree (get a row according to (x,y) position, emit signals when a row is
clicked, double-clicked...)
* The filechooser still need to be finished/rewritten [In progress: MoOm]
* More API work for the colorpicker. We need to be able to know the current color, and to know
when a color is changed
* Add better mouse control for the scrollbar: wheel and click on the trough

--------------------
[Things that still need to be implemented (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* spinner [In progress: CodeWarrior]
* textview [In progress: MoOm]
* combobox
* checkbox/radiobox menu items [In progress: eZeK]
* iconbox
* toolbar
* drag and drop [In progress: CodeWarrior]
* copy and paste [In progress: CodeWarrior]
* signals in dialog
* add spin buttons and sliders to colorpicker
