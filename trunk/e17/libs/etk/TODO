--------------------
[Bugs to fix (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* Fix a bug in etk_tree: when you've scrolled to the end of the left tree in etk_test, and if you
maximized the window, the tree is not correctly updated (maybe a bug in etk_scrolled_view)
* The tabs of the notebook doesn't have always a correct width (happens if you embed a notebook in
another notebook)
* Fix potential segvs with Amd64 and va_list
* Check if all the widgets can be reparented on a different window (i.e. unrealized then re-realized)
without causing any problem
* Check if all the functions of all the widgets work even is the widget is not realized
(i.e. attached to a window)
* Fix the focus problems in the notebook (you can focus children which are on an invisible page)
* Sometimes the window of a menu is not hidden when the menu is popped_down
* The labels sometimes does not returns its ideal size requisition (happens when there is a <br>)
Maybe a bug of the evas textblock
* Fix and optimize the colorpicker
* Sometimes, the mouse cursor is not reset when you stop resizing a row in the tree

--------------------
[Things that need to be improved (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* Improve the entry: add selection supports, better keyboard navigation [In progress: MoOm]
* Allow the theme to change the color/font/style of the labels
* More API work for the tree (get a row according to (x,y) position, emit signals when a row is
clicked, double-clicked...)
* The filechooser still need to be finished/rewritten
* More API work for the colorpicker. We need to be able to know the current color, and to know
when a color is changed
* The progress bar shouldn't inherit from etk_bin. And we shoudl maybe separate the "pulsing"
and the "normal" progress bars. Also separate the horizontal and the vertical progress bars.
* Add better mouse control for the scrollbar: wheel and click on the trough

--------------------
[Things that still need to be implemented (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* spinner [In progress: CodeWarrior]
* textview [In progress: MoOm]
* combobox
* checkbox/radiobox menu items
* iconbox
* toolbar
* drag and drop
* copy and paste
