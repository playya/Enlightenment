[Bugs to fix (in order of pripority)]
--------------------
* Fix a bug in etk_tree: when you've scrolled to the end of the left tree in etk_test, and if you
maximized the window, the tree is not correctly updated (maybe a bug in etk_scrolled_view)
* etk_paned_position_set() does not work if the paned is not realized
* Fix the focus problems in the notebook (you can focus children which are on an invisible page)
* Sometimes the window of a menu is not hidden when the menu is popped_down

Maybe a bug of the evas textblock
