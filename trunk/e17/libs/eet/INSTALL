COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

NOTE: You MUST make install Eet for it to run properly.

NOTE: for compilation with MinGW, fnmatch.h is probably missing.
      That file can be found here:

      It should be installed in the mingw include directory.
