COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure

( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )

Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

NOTE: You MUST make install Eet for it to run properly.

NOTE: For compilation with MinGW, fnmatch.h is probably missing.
      That file can be found here:

      It should be installed in the mingw include directory.

NOTE: For compilation with mingw32ce, run configure with the option

--host=arm-wince-mingw32ce

NOTE: For compilation with cegcc, you have to do the following steps:

1) After having run autogen.sh, add in config.sub file:

	cegcc)
		basic_machine=arm-unknown
		os=-cegcc
		;;

after the mingw32ce case

2) in config.sub, add -cegcc* after -pe*. You should have a line like:
	      | -cygwin* | -pe* | -cegcc* | -psos* | -moss* | -proelf* | -rtems* \

3) run configure with the option

--host=arm-wince-cegcc

NOTE: If you want to be able to run make check, you need library check
      from http://check.sourceforge.net/.

NOTE: If you want to be able to run coverage test over eet, you will need
      lcov from http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php.

NOTE: For coverage support you also need check support.
