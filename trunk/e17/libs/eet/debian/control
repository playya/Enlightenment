Description: Enlightenment file chunk reading/writing library
 Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a
 file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allow
 fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as zip
 itself has more complexity than we need, and it was much simpler to implement
 this once here.
 .
 It's small, fast, and does a job. It's heavily commented and fully documented.
