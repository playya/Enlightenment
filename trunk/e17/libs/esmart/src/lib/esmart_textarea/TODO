Simple:
=======
- handle up / down movement when lower line longer that top one and v/v
- remove all hardcoded values

Medium:
=======
- add mouse selection
- when we reach the top / botton line, up / down need special cases
- if on the last line and hit enter, cursor doesnt move till you enter 
  a character
- handle empty lines	       

Hard:
=====
- add copy / paste (clipboard support)
- sort out \n removal
- look into fact that at end of line, cursor is 1 pos ahead
- save / restore text with \n

Insane:
=======
- ambitious? add color coding
