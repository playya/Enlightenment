Epsilon:
This is a small, display independent, and quick thumbnailing library.
The lib itself conforms to the standard put forth by freedesktop.org
You can find out more information about it at
http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html.  It seemed better to
break it out into a component that only depended on what was absolutely
necessary.  Upon showing raster the wonders of freedesktop.org
thumbnailing, he proclaimed that it was far to slow, this prompted him
to write epeg.  Epeg offers very noticeable speed increases to this
standard, but is only available if the input image is a jpeg file.  If
the file is anything other than jpg, the traditional freedesktop.org png
thumbnailing will occur.  To show the speed increase epeg offers,
Epsilon builds with and without epeg.

Some Tests I ran here came out looking like the following:
90M	~/Images/ - Mixed png, xcf, gif, and jpg
just libpng and imlib
   First Pass:  36.15s real    33.30s user     0.96s system
   Second Pass:  0.06s real     0.04s user     0.00s system
   Thumbnails generated - 5.1M of space
epeg enabled
   First Pass:  14.67s real    14.13s user     0.47s system
   Second Pass:  0.06s real     0.01s user     0.01s system
   Thumbnails generated - 2.0M of space
