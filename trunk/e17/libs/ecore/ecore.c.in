Ecore modules at once.

@section intro What is Ecore?

Ecore is a clean and tiny event loop library with many modules to do lots of
convenient things for a programmer, to save time and effort.

It's small and lean, designed to work on embedded systems all the way to
large and powerful multi-cpu workstations. It serialises all system signals,
events etc. into a single event queue, that is easily processed without
needing to worry about concurrency. A properly written, event-driven program
using this kind of programming doesn't need threads, nor has to worry about
concurrency. It turns a program into a state machine, and makes it very
robust and easy to follow.

Ecore gives you other handy primitives, such as timers to tick over for you
and call specified functions at particular times so the programmer can use
this to do things, like animate, or time out on connections or tasks that take
too long etc.

Idle handlers are provided too, as well as calls on entering an idle state
(often a very good time to update the state of the program). All events that
enter the system are passed to specific callback functions that the program
sets up to handle those events. Handling them is simple and other Ecore
modules produce more events on the queue, coming from other sources such as
file descriptors etc.

Ecore also lets you have functions called when file descriptors become active
for reading or writing, allowing for streamlined, non-blocking IO.

Here is an exmaple of a simple program and its basic event loop flow:

@section work How does Ecore work?

Ecore is very easy to learn and use. All the function calls are designed to
be easy to remember, explicit in describing what they do, and heavily
name-spaced. Ecore programs can start and be very simple.

For example:

@code
#include <Ecore.h>

int main(int argc, const char **argv)
{
  ecore_init();
  ecore_app_args_set(argc, argv);
  ecore_main_loop_begin();
  ecore_shutdown();
  return 0;
}
@endcode

This program is very simple and does't check for errors, but it does start up
and begin a main loop waiting for events or timers to tick off. This program
doesn't set up any, but now we can expand on this simple program a little
more by adding some event handlers and timers.

@code
#include <Ecore.h>

Ecore_Timer         *timer1     = NULL;
Ecore_Event_Handler *handler1   = NULL;
double               start_time = 0.0;

int timer_func(void *data)
{
  printf("Tick timer. Sec: %3.2f\n", ecore_time_get() - start_time);
  return 1;
}

int exit_func(void *data, int ev_type, void *ev)
{
  Ecore_Event_Signal_Exit *e;

  e = (Ecore_Event_Signal_Exit *)ev;
  if (e->interrupt)      printf("Exit: interrupt\n");
  else if (e->quit)      printf("Exit: quit\n");
  else if (e->terminate) printf("Exit: terminate\n");
  ecore_main_loop_quit();
  return 1;
}

int main(int argc, const char **argv)
{
  ecore_init();
  ecore_app_args_set(argc, argv);  
  start_time = ecore_time_get();
  handler1 = ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT, exit_func, NULL);
  timer1 = ecore_timer_add(0.5, timer_func, NULL);  
  ecore_main_loop_begin();
  ecore_shutdown();
  return 0;
}
@endcode

In the previous example, we initialize our application and get the time at
which our program has started so we can calculate an offset. We set
up a timer to tick off in 0.5 seconds, and since it returns 1, will
keep ticking off every 0.5 seconds until it returns 0, or is deleted
by hand. An event handler is set up to call a function - exit_func(),
whenever an event of type ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT is received (CTRL-C
on the command line will cause such an event to happen). If this event
occurs it tells you what kind of exit signal was received, and asks
the main loop to quit when it is finished by calling
ecore_main_loop_quit().

The handles returned by ecore_timer_add() and ecore_event_handler_add() are 
only stored here as an example. If you don't need to address the timer or 
event handler again you don't need to store the result, so just call the 
function, and don't assign the result to any variable.

This program looks slightly more complex than needed to do these simple
things, but in principle, programs don't get any more complex. You add more
event handlers, for more events, will have more timers and such, BUT it all
follows the same principles as shown in this example.

@page Ecore_Config_Page The Enlightened Property Library

The Enlightened Property Library (Ecore_Config) is an adbstraction
from the complexities of writing your own configuration. It provides
many features using the Enlightenment 17 development libraries.

To use the library, you:
@li Set the default values of your properties.
@li Load the configuration from a file.  You must set the default values
    first, so that the library knows the correct type of each argument.

See @ref config_basic_example.c for an example.

/**
@page Ecore_ADT_Page Ecore Abstract Data Types

This page briefly describes the different abstract data types
that are provided by the Ecore library for general usage.  You need to
include the @link Ecore_Data.h Ecore_Data.h @endlink to use them.

@section Ecore_ADT_List List

A list is a simple data type where one each piece of data points to
another piece of data.

Associated modules include the following:
@li @ref Ecore_Data_List_Add_Item_Group

@section Ecore_ADT_DList Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is like a linked list, only each piece of data
can also point to the piece before it.

@section Ecore_ADT_Hash Hash

@todo Finish this.

/**

/**
@defgroup Ecore_Job_Group Ecore Jobs

*/

/**
@defgroup Idle_Group Idle Handlers

Callbacks that are called when the program enters or exits an idle state.

The ecore main loop enters an idle state when it is waiting for timers
to time out, data to come in on a file descriptor or any other event
to occur.  You can set callbacks to be called when the main loop
enters an idle state, during an idle state or just after the program
wakes up.

Enterer callbacks are good for updating your program's state, if it
has a state engine.  Once all of the enterer handlers are called, the
program will enter a "sleeping" state.

Idler callbacks are called when the main loop has called all enterer
handlers.  They are useful for interfaces that require polling and
timers would be too slow to use.

If no idler callbacks are specified, then the process literally goes
to sleep.  Otherwise, the idler callbacks are called continuously
while the loop is "idle", using as much CPU as is available to the
process.

Exiter callbacks are called when the main loop wakes up from an idle
state.
