Examine 0.0.1

Examine is an interface for configuring applications that use ecore_config from
the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL).
In the Examine package are two applications, examine (still very basic) and
exsh.
These applications connect to the configuration library and allow the user to
alter configurations.

To test this try running equate from misc and then "exsh equate" (or
"examine equate" for a non-functional graphical interface).
