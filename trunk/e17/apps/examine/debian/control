Description: Examine is an interface for configuring applications
 that use ecore_config from the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL).
 In the Examine package are two applications, examine (still very basic) and
 exsh.  These applications connect to the configuration library and allow the
 user to alter configurations.
