WARNING : 
This app can damage your ~/.e/e/apps/emphasis/cover.eet
Please make a backup before using it.
If the cover editor or emphasis say something like :
"Can't open ~/.e/e/apps/emphasis/cover.eet blabla"
your file is crushed, replace it by the backup. 
(or just remove it to have a new one)

README :
This is a quick made app to edit your cover database.
It's a temporary app. Emphasis will handle this by itself (better than that).
