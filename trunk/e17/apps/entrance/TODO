TODO List
=========

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BUGS AND ANNOYANCES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Internationalization issues with date/time format - LANG support
* FreeBSD waitpid() bug in entrance_login.c (Bug #309)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Create abstracted interface for obtaining system session list.
  - Add functions for finding session list on various distributions
  - Move entrance-definded sessions out of config into $prefix/share/xsessions/.
*** Handle sessions that crash immediately gracefully by providing some kind of
  custom error message a la GDM 
* Xinerama - widgets follow mouse pointer from screen to screen
** GUI configuration tool - Launched from within entrance, so we can configure
  without logging in to the window manager. Allow optional root password, just
  like GDM does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* XDMCP support
* Add custom user edje to default theme

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ADDITIONAL USER GENERATED FEATURE REQUESTS FROM THE COLLAB4 ML. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Tab focus change
* Session list is currently broken (it sets the layer/raises it etc, after being
  swallowed).
* No User listing currently.
* Session list and User list _need_ to be scrollable and the userlist needs to 
  possibly handle massive lists of 1000's of users and not take forever to come
  up (take a leaf out of e17's fm2 code for listting users).
* A face browser would be just awesome.
* KDM has a lilo hack that allows you to select which lilo option to reboot
  to directly from the Login Manager. Would be nice to have this too :)
* xrandr support in GUI config, so E can worry about that less.
