TODO List

KEY
========
*** - Features that we need Yesterday!!!
** 	- Features that we need right now!!
*   - Features that won't hurt if we had them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BUGS AND ANNOYANCES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Internationalization issues with date/time format - LANG support
* FreeBSD waitpid() bug in entrance_login.c (Bug #309)
* Add icons back to the session list
* Rip out and rework the smart objects used in Entrance (or rather not used)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Create abstracted interface for obtaining system session list.
  - Add functions for finding session list on various distributions
  - Move entrance-definded sessions out of config into $prefix/share/xsessions/.
*** Handle sessions that crash immediately gracefully by providing some kind of
  custom error message a la GDM 
* Xinerama - widgets follow mouse pointer from screen to screen
** GUI configuration tool - Launched from within entrance, so we can configure
  without logging in to the window manager. Allow optional root password, just
  like GDM does.
** Loadable Entrance Modules ala e gadman(move halt, reboot, time, to modules)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* XDMCP support
* Add custom user edje to default theme
* Add suspend and hibernate support eventually via modules, these are distro 
  dependent apparently)
* Add battery module, mpd client module (possible to steal from emphasis?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ADDITIONAL USER GENERATED FEATURE REQUESTS FROM THE COLLAB4 ML. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Tab focus change
** No User listing currently.
** Session list and User list _need_ to be scrollable and the userlist needs to 
  possibly handle massive lists of 1000's of users and not take forever to come
  up (take a leaf out of e17's fm2 code for listting users).
* A face browser would be just awesome.
* KDM has a lilo hack that allows you to select which lilo option to reboot
  to directly from the Login Manager. Would be nice to have this too :)
* xrandr support in GUI config, so E can worry about that less.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SOME REALY FUNKY AND FEATURISTIC IDEAS, UNREFINED - what does raster smoke at nite? ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Have something like a special user mode? application mode? So that someone can
  login like "media center" user, and not have to authenticate. In media center
  mode, all you see is a media center app like rage? etc. Other modes should be
  easily configurable, so users can create new modes like, Quake/Doom mode,
  SETI mode (which will have some bling while doing SETI :) ). Ideally, this modes,
  should even allow you to set key bindings, so you can use say a remote controller.
* Some funky authentication schemes - for instance, entrance, works with pam to all login
  from usb thumbdrive, thumbprint scanners, etc. Can even go further with the usb drive
  to allow user use the usb drive as their home directory.
* Entrance have a mini mode that is started by init as a bootup manager (running in fb or
  with minimal X). When everything is properly launched and ready, entrance will now switch
  into FULL entrance mode.
