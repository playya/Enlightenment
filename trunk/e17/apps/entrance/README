Introduction
------------

Entrance (v.) 
1. To put into a trance.
2. To fill with delight, wonder, or enchantment.

Entrance is the next generation of Elogin, a login/display manager for
Linux XFree86 systems. It is designed to be extremely customizable and
aesthetically attractive -- a refreshing relief from the traditional
dull and boring interfaces of XDM and its descendants.

Compiling & Installing
----------------------

To compile, you need the following libraries (if you're using a
package-based system, be sure to install the devel packages):

- Evas (>= 1.0.0pre4). Evas 0.6 will NOT work.
- Edb
- Ebg
- Ecore
- PAM (optional)

Then, type:
> ./autogen.sh
> make
> su -c 'make install'

You will need to copy the file config/pam.d/entrance to /etc/pam.d for 
PAM authentication to work successfully.

Usage
-----

To start an X session using Entrance, just type 'entranced' at the prompt. 
Entrance also works well with initscripts, so you can modify 
/etc/X11/prefdm or /etc/init.d/dm to launch entranced. For those who would
like to see what Entrance looks like before using it to start sessions,
you may edit src/client/entrance.h and specify #define X_TESTING 1 
(instead of 0). This will cause Entrance to launch in a 640x480 window,
and xterm will be executed instead of the selected session.

WARNING: Do not attempt to launch entranced from an existing session. It
will cause all sorts of havoc and may even blow a hole in the back of
your monitor. Run "entrance" instead.

To set up your sessions, edit the build_config.sh script in the data/config
directory before compiling to specify the names of the X sessions on your 
machine. After installation, you will need to directly edit
/etc/entrace_config.db using an EDB editor like edb_gtk_ed.  The default 
sessions are designed to work on a Debian 3.0 installation, so you will 
likely need to update your db before Entrance can work for you. While 
adding sessions, please note that:

- A session without a path is assumed to be an Xsession name, and will be
  launched using Xsession. Otherwise, the specific path will be executed
  (this is useful for those of you using E17, for example).
- The Failsafe session should be left as is (with "failsafe" as path)
- You do not need to add a default session; that is added automatically.
- You need to update the session count entry before you finish.

If you wish to use PAM for authentication, set the option
/entrance/use_pam_auth to 1. THIS IS RECOMMENDED unless you do not have
PAM (which would be Slackware, LFS and similar braindead distros ;) ).

You may also want to add images for users in the appropriate
directory so that they come up while you log in. For example, if your
login was foo, then you would need to add "foo.png" to that directory
for it to come up. The location of this image is now specified in config
as either in the system directory ($PREFIX/share/entrance/images/users/)
or in the user's home directory ($HOME/.e/entrance/). The config format is
as follows:

/entrance/user/count = <number of users in config>
/entrance/user/<n>/name = <username>
/entrance/user/<n>/image = <image filename>
/entrance/user/<n>/sys = <1 for system directory, 0 for home directory>

<n> is an index starting from zero.

Also, if $PREFIX/share/entrance/images/users/_default.png exists, it will 
be used as the default image if an image is not available for a user.

Take a look at buildtheme.sh in the BlueCrystal theme directory as a
guide to the theme format.
