Introduction
------------

Entrance (v.) 
1. To put into a trance.
2. To fill with delight, wonder, or enchantment.

Entrance is the next generation of Elogin, a login/display manager for
Linux XFree86 systems. It is designed to be extremely customizable and
aesthetically attractive -- a refreshing relief from the traditional
dull and boring interfaces of XDM and its descendants.

Compiling & Installing
----------------------

To compile, you need the following libraries (if you're using a
package-based system, be sure to install the devel packages):

- Evas (>= 1.0.0pre4). Evas 0.6 will NOT work.
- Edb
- Ebg
- Ecore
- PAM

Then, type:
> ./autogen.sh
> make
> su -c 'make install'

You will need to copy the file data/pam.d/entrance to /etc/pam.d for 
authentication to work successfully.

Usage
-----

To start an X session using Entrance, just type 'entranced' at the prompt. 
Entrance also works well with initscripts, so you can modify 
/etc/X11/prefdm or /etc/init.d/dm to launch entranced. For those who would
like to see what Entrance looks like before using it to start sessions,
you may edit src/client/entrance.h and specify #define X_TESTING 1 
(instead of 0). This will cause Entrance to launch in a 640x480 window,
and xterm will be executed instead of the selected session.

To set up your sessions, edit the build_config.sh script in the data/config
directory to specify the names of the X sessions on your machine. For
example, debian's sessions typically start with lowercase letters, so
nothing would work out of the box on that distro! :) While adding sessions,
please note that

- A session without a path is assumed to be an Xsession name, and will be
  launched using Xsession. Otherwise, the specific path will be executed
  (this is useful for those of you using E17, for example).
- The Failsafe session should be left as is (with "failsafe" as path)
- You do not need to add a default session; that is added automatically.
- You need to update the session count entry before you finish.

You may also want to add images for users in the data/images/users 
directory so that they come up while you log in. For example, if your
login was foo, then you would need to add "foo.png" to that directory
for it to come up. The image also needs to be the size specified in
the theme (in the default it is 192x223; this can be changed). Custom
image sizes (and names in the config) is on the TODO list for now.

Take a look at buildtheme.sh in the BlueCrystal theme directory as a
guide to the theme format.

Of course, patches and improvements are always welcome. :)

Slackware Note
--------------

It has come to my attention that a certain rogue Linux distro named
Slackware does not use PAM for authentication by default. Unfortunately
Entrance presently requires PAM for authentication and session setup, so
if you're using Slackware, you'll have to find a way to get PAM to work
on your system to use Entrance.
