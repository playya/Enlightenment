Elicit 0.8  (cleaner signals)
--------------------------------

Elicit is a screen zoomer / color picker written with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (http://www.enlightnement.org). It depends on a large number of libraries that are only available in CVS at the moment, see http://rephorm.com/rephorm/code/efl for installation instructions.

To install:

./configure
make
sudo make install

to run, just type: elicit

To change themes, edit ~/.e/apps/elicit/config.db (using edb_gtk_ed) and change the /settings/theme key to the basename of the theme (e.g. if the theme is named "spring.eet", change the value to "spring"). Elicit will look in /install_prefix/share/elicit/themes/ and ~/.e/apps/elicit/themes.

Currently only two themes are included: winter (the default) and spring.

Enjoy :)
