ABOUT
-------

Euphoria is an audio player which is based on Ecore, Evas and Edje.
It acts as a frontend to XMMS2.

INSTALLATION OF EUPHORIA & XMMS2
--------------------------------
 
To use build Euphoria you will need to first install XMMS2,
to do so:
1) Get XMMS-2.  Either:
	a) Check out XMMS2 from BitKeeper:
		$ bk clone debian.as:5555/xmms2
	 or,
	b) Download a nightly snapshot:
		http://xmms2.xmms.org/snapshots/
2) Get the XMMS2-Ecore patch.  Either:
	a) Check out the patch:	
	 	$ bk clone debian.as:5555/xmms2-ecore
	 or, 
	b) Download the patch: (May become outdated)
		http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/xmms2/files/xmmsclient-ecore.diff
3) Apply the patch to the XMMS-2 source, ie:
	$ cd xmms2-????
	$ patch -p1 < xmmsclient-ecore.diff
4) Build XMMS2.  In the xmms2-???? top source directory run
	the command: scons
5) Install XMMS2.  In the same directoy after the source
	finished building use the command (probly as root):
	# scons /usr/local
	This assumes that you want to install in /usr/local,
	change the patch accordingly.
6) You must manually install the headers, do this by
	copying the src/include/xmms and src/include/internal
	directories to the proper header location (probly /usr/local/include)
7) Done.  XMMS2 is ready to fly, start the daemon via "xmms2d"
	and use the CLI interface with the "xmms2" command.

Now you can build Euphoria.  Before you start make sure your
EFL installation is current (Gentoo users only get updated
every week, that may not be current enough).  If you have problems
it is likely due to old EFL installs, remember this is live
development code so even an hour can be too old.  Assuming
everything has been done properly as outlined above Euphoria
should build like you expect it to:
1) Bootstrap the build enviroment using the command "./autogen.sh"
2) Configure the build enviroment using "./configure".  Make sure
	you look at the avalible build options ala "./configure --help"
3) Build Euphoria ala "make".
4) Install Euphoria ala "make install" as root most likely.
	Note that Euphoria will not function if it is not installed.


At this point your ready to rock.  Start Euphoria but make sure
the XMMS2 Daemon is running (start via: "xmms2d").  You may want
to install the Euphoria config database by following the instructions
in the following section (there is a sample/default euphoria.db in the etc/
directory).

RUNNING EUPHORIA
----------------

For the time being (as of this writting) you need to manage your
play list using the CLI client.  An example session would be:

1) Open an Eterm and start the daemon so you can see debugging
	information: "xmms2d"
2) Open an Eterm to control XMMS2, use the following commands:
	$ xmms2 add /path/to/some/files
 	$ xmms2 add http://205.188.234.65:8022
	$ xmms2 list
	(now the playlist has stuff in it)
3) Start Euphoria with no options.

You can change themes using the euphoria.db explained below.


CREATING A PERSONAL EUPHORIA CONFIG
-----------------------------------

Euphoria can get some configuration information from a personal
configuration file thanks to EDB.  To create one follow 
these sets:

 1) Create the directory ~/.e/apps/euphoria
 2) Using the EDB tool of choice create a euphoria.db
	(ie: "edb_gtk_ed euphoria")
 3) Add the following keys:
	/euphoria/evas_engine
	/euphoria/output_plugin
	/euphoria/theme	
 4) If you wish to use GL or FB: 
  a)	Set evas_engine to a string type with the value "gl" or "fb".
 5) If you wish to use a non-default theme:
  a)    Create the directory: ~/.e/apps/euphoria/themes
  b)    Copy the EETs for the themes you want to use there.
  c)    Set theme to a string type with the name of the theme minus the .eet
		(ie: iio.eet is put in the edb as just "iio")

If you do not with to over-ride the default setting for Euphoria,
simply don't create the key, or leave the type as int.

You can also use the following directories:
 ~/.e/apps/euphoria/fonts      Fonts for use by Euphoria themes

FAQ
-------

Q: Why another damned audio player?
A: -> The purpose of Euphoria has always been to be used as a vehicle
by which to better learn the EFL components.

An audio player was chosen because it's interesting, the OggVorbis
API is very simple and can easily drawn on Ecore's strengths
(ie: idlers and timers) and provides a number of interesting interface
possibilities.

Q: Will you support WinAmp skins?
A: -> Nope.... go use XMMS(1) if you want traditional skins.
Refer to the first question.

But I will admit that I have considered the possiblity of automating
the conversion of WinAmpv3 skins (.wal's) to Edje.
It doesn't look hard, and Edje can do everything and more that WinAmp
can do with it's interface, but in a far more general way.

The problem is really just parsing all that XML (the WA skin config
files are now XML).  With PERL there could probly be an easy conversion,
but if there is one thing I hate parsing it's XML.

It would instantly make this audio player the player to use though!
