CREATING A PERSONAL EUPHORIA CONFIG
----------------------------------

Euphoria can get some configuration information from a personal
configuration file thanks to EDB.  To create one follow 
these sets:

 1) Create the directory ~/.e/apps/euphoria
 2) Using the EDB tool of choice create a euphoria.db
	(ie: "edb_gtk_ed euphoria")
 3) Add the following keys:
	/euphoria/evas_engine
	/euphoria/output_plugin
	/euphoria/theme	
 4) If you wish to use GL or FB: 
  a)	Set evas_engine to a string type with the value "gl" or "fb".
 5) If you wish to use a non-default theme:
  a)    Create the directory: ~/.e/apps/euphoria/themes
  b)    Copy the EETs for the themes you want to use there.
  c)    Set theme to a string type with the name of the theme minus the .eet
		(ie: iio.eet is put in the edb as just "iio")

If you do not with to over-ride the default setting for Euphoria,
simply don't create the key, or leave the type as int.

You can also use the following directories:
 ~/.e/apps/euphoria/fonts      Fonts for use by Euphoria themes

FAQ
-------

Q: Why another damned audio player?
A: -> The purpose of Euphoria has always been to be used as a vehicle
by which to better learn the EFL components.

An audio player was chosen because it's interesting, the OggVorbis
API is very simple and can easily drawn on Ecore's strengths
(ie: idlers and timers) and provides a number of interesting interface
possibilities.

Q: Will you support WinAmp skins?
A: -> Nope.... go use XMMS(1) if you want traditional skins.
Refer to the first question.

But I will admit that I have considered the possiblity of automating
the conversion of WinAmpv3 skins (.wal's) to Edje.
It doesn't look hard, and Edje can do everything and more that WinAmp
can do with it's interface, but in a far more general way.

The problem is really just parsing all that XML (the WA skin config
files are now XML).  With PERL there could probly be an easy conversion,
but if there is one thing I hate parsing it's XML.

It would instantly make this audio player the player to use though!
