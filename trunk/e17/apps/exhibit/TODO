* BUGS:
=======

- fix autocomplete (combobox?)
- if we're looking at a LOT of images and change dir before they have
  finished loading, then the images will thumbnail and load in the current dir
  
+ if we're scrolled to the end of the dir tree, clicking on a dir needs to
  reset the scrollbar to the top.
