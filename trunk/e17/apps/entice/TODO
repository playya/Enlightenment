		    has been modified(i.e. rotated)
		    Add an "EnticeImageModified" Signal

* Add an entice-ish display mode to the container object in
		    e17/proto/esmart

* Handle more than just keys in entice_keys.[ch] i.e. modifiers

* Edje Part to get previewed image name and attrs

* Find a way to represent, what's visible currently, to the
  EnticeScroller

* Hook in delete callbacks, should be pretty easy

* Trash Can ? Somehow i missed this functionality in the old version

* update debian/ directory so debs can be built
