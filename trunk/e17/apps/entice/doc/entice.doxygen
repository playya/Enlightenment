@section intro What is Entice?

Entice is yet another image viewer.  Why write another image viewer you
ask?  In the past entice was an application with tons of hard coded
effects.  These effects were very pleasing to the eye, but everyone's
entice application looked the same.  
@image html entice.jpg 
Enter Edje.  With Edje in mind most
of entice was rewritten from the ground up.  The applications
functionality was broken out, and Edje signals handle communication with the
theme so the displayed items stay current.  For the themer, communication
with entice is bidirectional, sometimes you'll have to emit signals to it,
while other times you'll have to be aware of signals entice is emitting and
act upon them in your theme.  


@section running How do I use entice now that I've got it installed ?

First, locate some images.
@subsection basicops How to load up images in entice.
Entice will take all of the command line arguments it is fed and try to
load them as image files.  Entice won't add the same file twice, and it
will only load images files.  
@verbatim
$ entice ./Images/*
@endverbatim
Should open up a new entice window with the first image file you
specified on the command line preloaded.  Entice makes use of
Interprocess Communication(IPC) to send a list of files to an already
existing entice window if one is currently running.  What this means in
plain english is that entice is smart enough to know only to open one
instance of itself, and load all the images there.
@verbatim
$ entice ./Images2/*
@endverbatim
Would not open up a new window displaying the contents of ./Images2, but
instead it sends all of those files to the currently running instance of
entice silently adding them to the filelist.
@subsection configops Your entice config file
Your entice configuration database holds various things that entice
wants to keep track of between uses.  To look at the available values
try.
@verbatim
$ edb_gtk_ed ~/.e/apps/entice/config.db
@endverbatim

@subsection keyops How can I bind keys to signals in entice?
@verbatim
$ edb_gtk_ed ~/.e/apps/entice/config.db
@endverbatim

@subsection themes How can I install a theme I downloaded?
If you downloaded a theme called winter.eet copy it to your user theme
directory.
@verbatim
$ cp winter.eet ~/.e/apps/entice/themes/
@endverbatim
If there were additional fonts that came with the theme, copy them to your
user fonts directory.
@verbatim
$ cp *.ttf ~/.e/apps/entice/fonts/
@endverbatim

@section requirements What does Entice require?

Entice relies on a lot of libraries most notably
  - Edb (library)
  - Eet (library)
  - Imlib2 (library)
  - Imlib2_loaders (library)
  - Evas (library)
  - Ecore (library)
  - Edje (library)
  - Epeg (library)
  - Epsilon (library)
  - Esmart (library)

The following instructions assume you've checked out the e17 directory
from cvs.  
@verbatim
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.enlightenment.sf.net:/cvsroot/enligtenment login 
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.enlightenment.sf.net:/cvsroot/enligtenment \
co e17/libs/edb e17/libs/eet e17/libs/imlib2 e17/libs/imlib2_loaders \
e17/libs/evas e17/libs/ecore e17/libs/edje e17/libs/epeg e17/libs/epsilon \
e17/proto/esmart e17/apps/entice
@endverbatim

That should fetch all the libraries you'll need to run entice.

@verbatim
1. You need Edb from cvs
  cd e17/libs/edb; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

2. You need Eet from cvs
  cd e17/libs/eet; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

3. You need Imlib2 > 1.1.0 
  cd e17/libs/imlib2; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

4. You need imlib2_loaders
  cd e17/libs/imlib2_loaders; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

5. You need Evas from cvs
  cd e17/libs/evas; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install
  
6. You need Ecore from cvs
  cd e17/libs/ecore; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

7. You need Edje from cvs
  cd e17/libs/edje; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

8. You need Epeg from cvs
  cd e17/libs/epeg; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

9. You need Epsilon from cvs
  cd e17/libs/epsilon; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

10. You need Esmart from cvs
  cd e17/proto/esmart; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

11. You need entice from cvs
  cd e17/apps/entice; ./autogen.sh; make; sudo make install

@endverbatim
