@section intro What is Entice?

Entice is yet another image viewer.  Why right another image viewer you
ask?  In the past entice was an application with tons of hard coded
effects.  These effects were very pleasing to the eye, but everyone's
entice application looked the same.  Enter Edje.  With Edje in mind most
of entice was rewritten from the ground up.  The applications
functionality was broken out, and Edje signals handle the actual
functionality of entice.  It is the themers job to tell entice what to
do, and it's entice's job to do it right.  



@section requirements What does Entice require?

Entice relies on a lot of libraries most notably
  - Edb (library)
  - Evas (library)
  - Edje (library)
  - Esmart (library)
  - Imlib2 (library)
  - Ecore (library)
  - Ecore_Evas (library)

There is no need to reinvent the wheel all the time.

@verbatim
1. You need Edb from cvs

  cvs co e17/libs/edb
  cd e17/libs/edb
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

2. You need Imlib2 > 1.1.0 - the more loaders, the more entice will be able to view. If you're using cvs

  cvs co e17/libs/imlib2
  cd e17/libs/imlib2
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

3. You need Evas from cvs

  cvs co e17/libs/evas
  cd e17/libs/evas
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure \
  --enable-software-x11 \
  --enable-gl-x11 \

  --enable-convert-32-rgb-rot-0 \
  --enable-convert-32-rgb-rot-90 \
  --enable-convert-32-rgb-rot-270
  make
  sudo make install
  cd
  
4. You need Ecore from cvs

  cvs co e17/libs/ecore
  cd e17/libs/ecore
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure \
  --enable-ecore-x \
  --enable-ecore-evas \
  --enable-ecore-evas-gl \
  --enable-ecore-job \
  --enable-ecore-con \
  --enable-ecore-ipc
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

5. You need Edje from cvs

  cvs co e17/libs/edje
  cd e17/libs/edje
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

6. You need Esmart from cvs

  cvs co e17/proto/esmart
  cd e17/proto/esmart
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

7. You need entice from cvs

  cvs co e17/apps/entice
  cd e17/apps/entice
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install
  cd

@section running How do I use entice now that I've got it installed ?

First, locate some images.
@subsection basicops How to load up images in entice.
Entice will take all of the command line arguments it is fed and try to
load them as image files.  Entice won't add the same file twice, and it
will only load images files.  
@verbatim
$ entice ./Images/*
@endverbatim
Should open up a new entice window with the first image file you
specified on the command line preloaded.  Entice makes use of
Interprocess Communication(IPC) to send a list of files to an already
existing entice window if one is currently running.  What this means in
plain english is that entice is smart enough to know only to open one
instance of itself, and load all the images there.
@verbatim
$ entice ./Images2/*
@endverbatim
Would not open up a new window displaying the contents of ./Images2, but
instead it sends all of those files to the currently running instance of
entice silently adding them to the filelist.
@subsection configops Your entice config file
Your entice configuration database holds various things that entice
wants to keep track of between uses.  To look at the available values
try.
@verbatim
$ edb_gtk_ed ~/.entice.db
@endverbatim

@subsection keyops How can I bind keys to signals in entice?
@verbatim
$ edb_gtk_ed ~/.entice.db
@endverbatim

@section signallisting Is there a comprehensive signal list entice knows about?
