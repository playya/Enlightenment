Entice 0.6.0

Entice is an image viewer using the new e17 libraries. To compile this
you need ecore (from the SPLIT tree, until raster merges it back in -
ecore SPLIT is the Way of the Future, and apps are being updated to use
it), evas, and Imlib. Soon it will also require edje.

Simple installation insturctions:
./autogen.sh
make
su
make install

Entice currently takes no commandline options. It takes as arguments a
list of images to load. Run with no arguments it tries to load all files
from the working directory (currently it even tries files that aren't
images). You can instead give a directory name as a single argument, and
it will load all images from this directory.

On the TODO list at present, in order of randomness, are:
* zooming behaviour is not quite there
* logo fade behaviour is a bit arbitrary and will be neatened soon
* ask for confirmation on file deletion
* make dragged thumbnails fade gradually as they approach the trashcan
  rather than suddenly as the cursor passes its boundary
* maybe add the ability to drag images from one position to another in
  the list
* maybe make the file info (name & size) fade out after a few seconds
* allow for slideshow behaviour
* allow users to rename/move image files from within entice

There are some known bugs also:
* image flipping does not update the image: doing a drag or other operation
  makes the changes appear
* moving the mouse while scrolling the imagelist breaks it heavily
* occasionally loses keyboard focus while fullscreen and is unable to
  recover
* sometimes the pop-up thumbnails get stuck in an infinite loop

Any bugs not mentioned here should be raised on Edevel, in #edevelop, or to
dh286@cam.ac.uk since I appear to be the maintainer.
