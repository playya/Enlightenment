Entice 0.6.0

Entice is in the process of being ported to Ecore2. It will currently compile,
and run with the same functionality as the old entice, minus a few features:

* DND support is not in Ecore2 yet
* window properties have not been sorted out
* does not search for existing entice windows on startup

However, a few minor bugs have been fixed and new features are being added.
On the TODO list at present, in order of randomness, are:
* building a file list from a directory rather than having to be passed names on
  the command line
* ask for confirmation on file deletion
* make dragged thumbnails fade gradually as they approach the trashcan
  rather than suddenly as the cursor passes its boundary
* maybe add the ability to drag images from one position to another in
  the list
* maybe make the file info (name & size) fade out after a few seconds
* make "Error loading x" messages appear properly rather than in the
  titlebar

There are some known bugs also:
* image flipping does not update the image: doing a drag or other operation
  makes the changes appear
Any bugs not mentioned here should be raised on Edevel, in #edevelop, or to
dh286@cam.ac.uk since I appear to be the de facto maintainer.
