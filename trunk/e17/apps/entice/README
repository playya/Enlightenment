Entice 0.6.0

Entice is in the process of being ported to Ecore2. It will currently compile,
and run with the same functionality as the old entice, minus a few features:

* DND support is not in Ecore2 yet
* window properties have not been sorted out
* does not search for existing entice windows on startup
* BUG: minor drawing problem with panel
* maybe one or two more I forgot about

However, a few minor bugs have been fixed. On the TODO list at present are:
* building a file list from a directory rather than having to be passed names on
  the command line

Any bugs not mentioned here should be raised on Edevel, in #edevelop, or to
dh286@cam.ac.uk (or to raster@rasterman.com).
