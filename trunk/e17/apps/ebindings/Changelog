	- Keybinds and Menus
	- everything compiles with -Wall -Werror -W =)
	- Different tabs are broken into their own [c,h] files.  Widgets are
	  declared static to keep from shit overlapping between tabs

	- Small abnormalities in certain things fixed.
	- Used the rest of the information from the actions.db to build a focus
	  interface.  I've only figured out a few things with it.  It'll prolly
	  transform into a "Do you want sloppy mouse focus?" or "Do you want to
	  have to click in everything for it to know you wanna type there?"
	  section but I figured I'd just get the data up on a notebook tab and
	  rethink it later.
	- Saving is more consistent
