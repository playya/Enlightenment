This directory contains the following epplets:
 - clock.fe 
   - large time-only display
 - clock2.fe
   - more graphical clock display with date as well as time

To use these epplets, simply copy this directory to ~/.e/desktop/default/.e_epplets.  This will show clock.fe by default.  In order to use clock2.fe, simply rename clock2.fe to clock.fe.

Thanks to:
  - Brian Mattern for helping me get started
  - Thibaud for the clock2 background graphic
    - The graphic is from his Saona theme (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=73252) for HoverDesk
