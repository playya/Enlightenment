  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: eap editor doesn't handle spaces in file paths for the .eap
* BUG: ghost windows happen if windows close when on another desktop or if
  windows are very short-lived
* BUG: k3b has minimization issues when burning cds (it tries to unminimize
  its window and this doesn't work)
* BUG: openoffice 2 when displaying a presentation with xinerama (multiple
  zones) weird things happen (the presentation doesnt display - it seemingly
  attaches to the 2nd zone, not the first), crashes have been reported too.
* BUG: dnd icon from window that has no .eap defining its icon to ibar and the
  ibar icon ends up blank (can't build .eap from ARGB pixels)
* BUG: edge flip for desktops still active if turned off when dragging a window
  off the desktop - either a separate config value (recommended) or turn it
  off for window dragging too
* BUG: desktop settings is missing preview
* BUG: modules need to destroy config dialogs on shutdown (otherwise - segv!)
* BUG: IBAR follower speed and autoscroll speed are not pixels / sec (they are
  recursive multiplication values). should invert gui values and display as a
  factor, not px/sec
* BUG: changing border from shaped to not shaped produces shadow bugs
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)
* BUG: if a user selects a border the border should not just change based on
  properties. if user selects a border in border selector, then lock border
* BUG: if you iconify a window and while iconified the window unmaps
  (rhythmbox does this a lot apparently) e doesnt realize and still thinks
  it's iconified.
* BUG: dnd to ibar is broken if you did an icon that isn't IN the ibar yet
  (from a window border) to either the very start or end of the ibar.
* BUG: in general fullscreen needs work, cleaning and testing. dont allow
  desktop switches for the desk a fullscreened window is on, nor allow windows
  to be raised above the fs win etc. ie the app must seem to be entirely fs for
  that zone.
* BUG: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that won't fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2
* BUG: Hiding the label of e_widget_slider causes the slider line to disappear

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* implement these maximise/fullscreen modes:
  Which of these should be different modes, and which should be options for
  a mode? i think they all should be distinct actions of their own bound
  to a key, button etc. which one of these the maximize button on a window
  will execute should be a configuration value though :)
  1. fullscreen (no border - resizes to default screen res). window is locked,
     no mouse bindings work. any focus change out of this window will go out of
     fullscreen mode
  2. zoom (changes screen res to match window, or closest res thats bigger
     than the window, centers it - no borders/title etc). window is locked, no
     mouse bindings work. any focus change out of this window will go out of
     zoom mode
  3. maximize (only title is displayed - program fills the rest of the screen)
     disable resize, shade, move etc. in this mode. iconify is ok.
  4. maximize2 (maximize window up to the edge of panels, gadgets etc. -
     disable all resizing and moving just like 1, 2 and 3 (maybe make border
     thinner to indicate this). disable stuff like 3.
  5. expand (just resize window to fill the same space as 4. - but it still can
      be shaded, resized, moved etc.)
  6. fill (expand to the nearest window edge or screen edge)
  for 5 and 6 you want to able to do this independently for width and height as
  well as for both at once. for 1. & 2. if window max size (or aspect
  adjusted size) is smaller that screen max size, fill in space in between
  with black. for 3. we want to fill the in bewteen space with some theme
  defined image data
* actions to make current zone different (warp mouse to there)
* titlebar/border expansion/gadget panel for modules to put window widgets in
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir
* ibar need to support label pop-ups
* ibar should support subdirs with pop-up icons...
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support text and color classes
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* make xrandr support get rotation and store it
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* shelves need to handle container resize (res change)
* shelves need to support gadcon "contents" config
* shelf gui config is ugly and badly arranged
* pager should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* EAP cache files can be hit and miss and have problems. move things to be
  explicit reloads.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* module api needs to move label and icon to data file (.eap file?), not api
* allow object paranoia to be a runtime option too

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* winlist and exebuf can let the mouse select items
* option to NOT raise on focus in click to focus
* switch to desktop of a new window if it opens on another desktop than the
  current one
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* tip/hint/suggestion dialog
* add tooltips
* add locale and encoding fields to eapp files (to launch eapp in that
  locale+encoding)
* add input method selector stuff to eapp - same as locale
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check engine can work on a given screen before using it
* non opaque move/resize
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
