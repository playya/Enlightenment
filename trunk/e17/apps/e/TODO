  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: match this window only doesnt fall back to other unused remembers
* BUG: make window sticky. send window to another desktop - get ghost window.
  should 1. make any such operation in the pager or menu useless and do
  nothing if the window is sticky and 2. remove the send window to menu if it
  is sticky and in the pager disallow dragging out of the pager desktop if
  the window is sticky.
* BUG: if app asks for borderless in properties - borderless toggle in menu
  doesn't have any effect.
* BUG: change exe name in basic mode in eap editor and icon vanishes (don't
  extract existing icon and write out to tmp .png while rebuilding).
* BUG: ghost windows happen if windows close when on another desktop or if
  windows are very short-lived
* BUG: openoffice 2 when displaying a presentation with xinerama (multiple
  zones) weird things happen (the presentation doesnt display - it seemingly
  attaches to the 2nd zone, not the first), crashes have been reported too.
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)
* BUG: if a user selects a border the border should not just change based on
  properties. if user selects a border in border selector, then lock border
* BUG: if you iconify a window and while iconified the window unmaps
  (rhythmbox does this a lot apparently) e doesnt realize and still thinks
  it's iconified.
* BUG: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that won't fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2
* BUG: Hiding the label of e_widget_slider causes the slider line to disappear
* BUG: Window locks should be honored by the pager (e.g. Lock me from
  changing position)
* BUG: in screen resolution change dialog the flip config is a pair of raidio
  buttons. it should be a pair of checkboxes to turn that flip bit on or
  off etc. etc.

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* if we want to do icons on the desktop - and as part of efm, i am thinking
  that we have little choice but to implement a .desktop file loader. this
  is not to hard - it's the xml jungle of the system menus that is sucky. the
  real problems are where to find the icons for the .desktop files.
* middle mouse on gadgets as a quick move/resize thing?
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir (and dnd from it into ibar etc.)
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support color classes (gui config  etc. etc.)
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* Window Border Icon > "Create Icon" needs to copy the ARGB icon data (into a 
  temp file?) and use that as the default icon.
* Dragging a non-eap icon from a border to the ibar should automatically
  create the icon and add that (instead of warning the user that this can't be
  done)

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If a user has set a border type on a window, don't bother to check for
  changes.
* border menu has dangerous close atr the bottom. if the widnwo is too far
  down then close is right next to the mouse - danger! move somewhere less
  dangerous.
* keybindings dialog doesn't conform its formatting or datatype naming to
  anything else in e17 - it needs fixing.
* need to do a massive theme spec overhaul. need to namespace signals, special
  named parts that are needed, specific what is NEEDED froma  theme, what is
  optional (in terms of parts, groups and signals). etc.
* when adding some gadgets like pager, ibox, ibar - they default to "plain"
  instead of inset. there should be a way for a gagdet to hint a default
  preferred look.
* default config for shelf is screwy and needs fixing - related to gadcon
  layout algorithm though.
* ipc is a mess. overgrown. hard to work with. what to do? remove?
* EAP cache files can be hit and miss and have problems. move things to be
  explicit reloads.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* winlist and exebuf can let the mouse select items
* switch to desktop of a new window if it opens on another desktop than the
  current one (optional too)
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas engine can work on a given screen before using it
* non opaque move/resize
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
* improve drag/resize of gadget items
* pager should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
