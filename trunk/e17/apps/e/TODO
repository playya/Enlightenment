  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: if iconified window quits qhile iconified and ibox is being used then
  e segv's
* BUG: dnd to ibar is broken if u did an icon that isn't IN the ibar yet
  (from a window border) to either the very start or end of the ibar.
* BUG: race condition on winlist activate via keypress and the key grab thus
  missing the alt key raise sometimes.
* BUG: dnd from konqueror on zone 0 to another konq on zone 1 with xinerama (2
  zones) causes segv
* BUG: e often forgets what window is focused so ctrl+alt+x for example doesnt
  close the current focused window... hmmmm
* BUG: in general fullscreen needs work, cleaning and testing. dont allow
  desktop switches for the desk a fullscreened window is on, nor allow windows
  to be raised above the fs win etc. ie the app must seem to be entirely fs for
  that zone.
* BUG: if you have 2 zones and you fill up zone 2 (right) mostly and then run
  a big xev (xev -g 1280x1024) that wont fit it gets placed offscreen to the
  right of zone 2
* BUG: if you alt-click on a module to move it, and the mouse happens to be right where a resize handle for a neighboring module is, it will resize that instead. We should probably just go to edit mode for the single module instead of _all_ modules.

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add fullscreen support (e16 xvidmode or xrandr style)
* implement thees maximise/fullscreen modes:
  Which of these should be different modes, and which should be options for
  a mode? i think they all should be distinct actions of their own bound
  to a key, button etc. which one of these the maximize button on a window
  will execute should be a configuration value though :)
  1. fullscreen (no border - resizes to default screen res). window is locked,
     no mouse bindings work. any focus change out of thsi window will go out of
     fullscreen  mode
  2. zoom (changes screen res to match window, or closest res thats bigger
     than the window, centers it - no borders/title etc). window is locked, no
     mouse bindings work. any focus change out of thsi window will go out of
     zoom  mode
  3. maximise (only title is displayed - program fills the rest of the screen)
     disable resize, shade, move etc. in this mode. iconify is ok.
  4. maximise2 (maximise window up to the edge of panels, gadgets etc. -
     disable all resizing and moving just like 1, 2 nd 3 (maybe make border
     thinner to indicate this). disable stuff like 3.
  5. expand (just resize window to fill the same space as 4. - but it still can
      be shaded, resized, moved etc.)
  6. fill (expand to the nearest window edge or screen edge)
  for 5 and 6 u want to able to do this independently for width and height as
  well as for both at once. for 1. & 2. if window max size (or aspect
  adjusted size) is smaller that screen max size, fill in space in between
  with black. for 3. we want to fill the inbewteen space with some theme
  defined image data
* netwm window types and states need addressing (do special/appropriate things)
  for each of them.
* do something with the icccm urgency field hint
* different borders for non-resizable windows, shaped windows etc.
* window icons should be able to be chosen if e eapp icon overrides netwm
  icon or the other way around (and remember this).
* actions to make current zone different (warp mouse to there)
* actions to make the current container different
* titlebar/border expansion/gadget panel for modules to put window widgets in
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* all menus need icons if they dont have them  yet:)
* gadget containers (shelves?) using popups as well as in-line in a canvas
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* different cursors for different parts of the screen
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir
* dnd from pager to other pagers/ to desktop/ibox etc.
* ibar should enable user to select different dirs to view per bar and allow
  new bars to be created or bars to be deleted
* ibar need to support label pop-ups
* ibar should support subdirs with pop-up icons...
* borders need to be able to change border theme on the fly by menu or app
  properties
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support text and color classes
* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* make xrandr support get rotation and store it
* gui config dialogs for all config
* "control panel" dialog need to be better to allow config dialogs to launch
  from it
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* modules need config dialogs instead of long winded menus
* remove module config menus (make them part of the module control panel etc.)
* alt-middle should go into resize mode on modules. (right now you have to guess where the resize handle will appear and alt-click there, or go into full edit mode.

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* return from ipc if the command failed or not
* ipc should give more feedback wheter the options are accepted or not.
* find all other instances of using e_error dialogs and use them only with low
  level errors than need attention no matter what.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist should in theory allow horizontal list layout not just vertical (set
  by the theme)
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* gadman needs some changes to virtualise the canvas/container the gadget
  ends up in (eg in popups or border)
* perhaps we should split focus and "selected" windows. selected window is
  what ocused is now and focus is something only affectinbg keyboard input. if
  the focus window becoems another managed window it becoems the selected
  window - otherwise click to focus or pointer focus will chose the selected
  window that may get the focus if it allows it...
* module api needs to move label and icon to data file (.eap file?), not api
* ibar lamp needs short timer on mouse out for hide before hiding (and del
  the time on mouse in)
* allow object paranoia to be a runtime option too

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add key input focus control for desktop modules
* break out desks x/y size config so you can have a different desktop size
  per zone - right now there is a signle global (use this later as the default
  for new/unconfigured zones)
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* screensaver/lock module
* tip/hint/suggestion dialog
* add tooltips
* add locale and encoding fields to eapp files (to launch eapp in that
  locale+encoding)
* add input method selector stuff to eapp - same as locale
* "run command" typebuffer thing
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas has eet support early on.
* pagers should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
* non opaque move/resize
* add window tabs (multiple clients in 1 border)
* add a button area expansion for borders ???
* add template button for expanded buttons ???
* maybe add systray module/support?
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
