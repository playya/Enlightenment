Some of the things (in very short form) that need to be done to E17...
(These are in no particular order)

  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: performance bug: e_app_new() is amazingly slow and heavy. see the FIXME
  comment in e_fm.c in _e_fm2_icon_icon_set()... this needs to be traced,
  profiled and leaned down by many factors :)
* BUG: smart placement seems to screw up if a shelf is at the top of the screen
* BUG: e17 screen res diaolg doesnt work under xephyr - why?
* BUG: "match this window only" doesnt fall back to other unused remembers
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* nuke the current eap cache mechanism entirely (and replace with .desktop
  cache)
* transition config dialog needs preview.
* fm2 needs way to replace or extend the right click menu (disable/enable
  rename/delete/refresh etc.)
* fm2 needs a mime filter
* middle mouse on gadgets as a quick move/resize thing?
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add setup/install wizard to seed .desktop files etc. etc.
* support color classes (gui config  etc. etc.)
* finish clientinfo dialog for borders (netwm props etc. etc.)
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* Dragging a non-desktop icon from a border to the ibar should automatically
  create the icon and add that (instead of warning the user that this can't be
  done)

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* client list menu could do with work on ordering, using separators to demark
  this desktop and other desktops, sorting by recently used, separate
  section for iconified apps etc. etc - configurable.
* cleanup windows menu item needs action wrapper
* remove a lot of ipc commands that should be done via the gui now
* remove config items marked for removal
* make default set of apps .desktop files in tarball
* about dialog can do with redesign
* bg gradient dialog needs a preview widget. also edje needs to be updated so
  we can do proper fills for non 0 angles.
* clientinfo dialog could be nicer - then again it is an obsucre thing.
* desklock's pam profile should be configurable as system-auth doesn't
  always work and the fallback checks might not work either.
* If a user has set a border type on a window, don't bother to check for
  changes.
* keybindings dialog doesn't conform its formatting or datatype naming to
  anything else in e17 - it needs fixing.
* need to audit, namespace and expand text and color classes
* need to specify what is NEEDED from a  theme, what is  optional (in terms of
  parts, groups and signals). etc.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* e_color_dialog needs to have an area for favorite and recently selected
  colors. store in config and use ilist? or store as color files and use
  e_fm2? or custom widget?
* virtualize e_bg to be able to put a bg in any canvas (given any desktop
  config input) and return an object.
* virtual desktops preview should allow clicking on a desk to access the
  "wallpaper" dialog. should default to only changing the clicked desktop
* desktop flip animations need to allow control over accel/decel and
  have a better ui - add wobble and controls etc. etc.

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* make fdo .desktop support work on debian & ubuntu
* full fm2 support as an icon fm needs work - beyond fsel needs and for icons
  on the desktop etc. etc.
* up arrow in exebuf with empty buf goes into history mode and up/down let u
  browse command history
* switch to desktop of a new window if it opens on another desktop than the
  current one (optional too)
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas engine can work on a given screen before using it
* add non-opaque move/resize (use shaped windows with canvases etc.)
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* file icons on the desktop (people ask for it) - xdnd for these
* pager should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
* add a dialog to allow selecting the default border from among those present
  in the theme (e.g. winter provides a 'square' border). after a theme change
  this should fall back to "default" if the selected one doesn't exist in the
  new theme.
* icons for all config panel items
* icons for most mime types
* icons for most menu items
* default battery theme could use slightly larger fonts
* default temp theme - larger font
* default cpufreq theme - larger font

  OPTIMISATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add evas pre/post render callbacks per evas canvas and callbacks per object
  for pre/post render too
* optimize clock theme (speed/cpu) (rotation in edje??? or evas???)
* evas could detect an image is scaled multiple times and keep a scaled copy
  that it could share in cache, and then punt the original back to cache.
* evas could support 8bbp alpha only images for dropshadow
* better app cache for .desktop files
* new fm code's file scanning isn't insanely fast - icon size calcs etc. speed
  up for special cases like list view?
* new fm code re-lays-out a dir every time the queue is processed - maybe try
  to speed this up
