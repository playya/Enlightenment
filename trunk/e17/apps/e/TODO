  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* apparently with locales other than english/c the about box textblock breaks
  newlines on every word (maybe the utf8 decode patch? for evas?)
* dnd to ibox, ibar, pager if module gagdets have "autoscroll" on makes the
  dnd area the WHOLE region of the gadget object - not just the visible part,
  so the dnd region is waay too big and may overlap eachother etc.

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* fm2 needs recursive deletes, moves, etc. that run in the "background"
  (idlers, etc.) and might pop up a progress dialog (or display progress in
  the fm2 view somehow).
* fm2 needs a right-click file properties dialog
* fm2 needs a way to set custom backgrounds and handle scrolling
* fm2 needs to display symlink info on files somehow
* fm2 needs to display more than 1 file being dragged (if more than 1 is being
  dragged)
* fm2 needs a way of mapping a mimetype to 1 or more commands to execute or
  internal e actions to do (like add as wallpaper etc.)
* fm2 needs a way to use custom icons per dir/file
* fm2 needs a way to bypass thumb gen anim on just a unrealize/realize as well
  as change state instantly if it already was selected
* fm2 needs a mime filter
* dnd needs to do xdnd properly.
* fwin: multi-mime open is too simplisitc. fix in fwin.c line 590 or so.
* fm2 needs icon views (auto-arrange, snap to grid and free placement), for
  fwin windows and the desktop
* middle mouse on gadgets as a quick move/resize thing?
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add setup/install wizard to seed .desktop files etc. etc.
* finish clientinfo dialog for borders (netwm props etc. etc.)
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled) like close, maximize, etc. etc. buttons.
* Dragging a non-desktop icon from a border to the ibar should automatically
  create the icon and add that (instead of warning the user that this can't be
  done)

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* need a config to add new mime types (or edit existing ones).
* e app editor needs to be able to let users select what mime types that app
  can handle :)
* applications config dialog is good - but "complex". people ask simple
  questions like "how do i add an app to my launcher bar", "how do i run an
  app on startup?". nice and generic tho the app config is - maybe it needs
  to somehow become mroe specific for each scenario? ie a dilog that ONLY
  handled adding an app (creating it or dnd/linking it in from existing apps).
* emit more signals to window borders when window move starts, stops, resize
  starts, stops, on raise, lower, etc. etc.
* client list menu could do with work on ordering, using separators to demark
  this desktop and other desktops, sorting by recently used, separate
  section for iconified apps etc. etc - configurable.
* remove a lot of ipc commands that should be done via the gui now
* remove config items marked for removal
* about dialog can do with redesign
* clientinfo dialog could be nicer - then again it is an obsucre thing.
* desklock's pam profile should be configurable as system-auth doesn't
  always work and the fallback checks might not work either.
* If a user has set a border type on a window, don't bother to check for
  changes in properties to change the border based on prop changes.
* need to audit, namespace and expand text and color classes
* need to specify what is NEEDED from a  theme, what is  optional (in terms of
  parts, groups and signals). etc.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* e_color_dialog needs to have an area for favorite and recently selected
  colors. store in config and use ilist? or store as color files and use
  e_fm2? or custom widget?
* virtualize e_bg to be able to put a bg in any canvas (given any desktop
  config input) and return an object.
* desktop flip animations need to allow control over accel/decel and
  have a better ui - add wobble and controls etc. etc.
* internal windows (config dialogs, etc) should re-open after a restart

  "NICE TO HAVE" FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* for startup - apps that say "wait for me befofe running the next app" have
  a timeout so if they never complete - complain and continue anyway.
* enlightenment_remote cmd's for logout, hibernate, reboot, suspend.
* nice to have a menu item for a window for "add keyboard shortcut to run this
  app" would be nice usability
* switch to desktop of a new window if it opens on another desktop than the
  current one (optional too)
* emit signal to submenu entries if they have a submenu shown for them or not
* setup configs for gnome and kde (as options) if they are installed (eg
  run gnome-settings-daemon).
* check evas engine can work on a given screen before using it
* add non-opaque move/resize (use shaped windows with canvases etc.)
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc.
  that overlay the screen
* pager should be able to be configured to control more than the current zone
  (select which zone they control)
* icons for all config panel items
* icons for most mime types

  OPTIMISATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add evas pre/post render callbacks per evas canvas and callbacks per object
  for pre/post render too
* optimize clock theme (speed/cpu) (rotation in edje??? or evas???)
* evas could detect an image is scaled multiple times and keep a scaled copy
  that it could share in cache, and then punt the original back to cache.
* evas could support 8bbp alpha only images for dropshadow
* on disk app cache for .desktop files, icons and paths
* new fm2 code's file scanning isn't insanely fast - icon size calcs etc. speed
  up for special cases like list view?
* new fm2 code re-lays-out a dir every time the queue is processed - maybe try
  to speed this up
