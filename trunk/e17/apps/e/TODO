Some of the things (in very short form) that need to be done to E17...

Also look at all the .c files - they have their own localized TODO lists

These are in no particular order:

* fix border raise/lower to use certain marker "windows" to not raise above or lower below (menus should always be above the top marker window for example)
* track mouse location on a border/desktop level
* add desktop object/element management interface (sanitise module hell there)
* add key input focus control for desktop modules
* finish off icccm support
* optimize clock theme (speed/cpu)
* make shading go in all 4 directions
* add keybindings
* add general actions to be hooked to button/key bindings

* add pagers
* add netwm support
* different cursors for different parts of the screen
* alt+tab status list of windows
* add a "taskbar"
* add cpu module
* add cpu speedstep module
* make root menus configurable (what mouse/key brings up what)
* add favorites apps menu items for editing (at the bottom or such)
* add a way to access all apps
* list window properties then only fetch the ones that exist on window map
* non opaque move/resize
* optimize dropshadow module to blure faster/more efficiently
* change evas and ecore_evas to create shape rect lists directly

* add clientinfo pane/popdown for borders
* add a button area expansion for borders
* add template button for expanded buttons

* add screen rotation info to managers
* make xrandr support get rotation
* add rotation to containers
* fix multihead support (executing with DISPLAY=:0.1 on screen 1 for example)
* xinerama support
* maybe add systray module/support?
* fix all loose ends
* allow object paranoia to be a runtime option too
* detect segv and report it (maybe turn on obj paranoia)
* add sliders, radio and check buttons for clientinfo pane
* display coords while moving/resizing
* add separate app menu bars at top of screen support
* add "osd" subsystem for things like volume controls on keybboards, etc. that overlay the screen
* add really nice "about" box with theme, authors credits list etc etc.
* init splash needs to be able to display icons for startup
* init splash needs te be able to be signalled "end of init" and it can respond with a "splash end" signal
