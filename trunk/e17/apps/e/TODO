  BUGS / FIXES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: "match this window only" doesnt fall back to other unused remembers
* BUG: if app asks for borderless in properties - borderless toggle in menu
  doesn't have any effect.
* BUG: change exe name in basic mode in eap editor and icon vanishes (don't
  extract existing icon and write out to tmp .png while rebuilding).
* BUG: ghost windows happen if windows close when on another desktop or if
  windows are very short-lived
* BUG: xdaliclock -transparent doesnt use shaped border (not handling shape
  change later)
* BUG: if you iconify a window and while iconified the window unmaps
  (rhythmbox does this a lot apparently) e doesnt realize and still thinks
  it's iconified.
* BUG: Hiding the label of e_widget_slider causes the slider line to disappear

  ESSENTIAL FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* fsel needs "add" button for favorites to add whataver directory is selected
  if any dir is selected (create symlink)
* fsel needs to clear the entry when entering a new dir
* fm2 .desktop parser needs to handle i18n
* fm2 needs a mime filter
* fm2 needs to have a mime & filetype -> icon mapping
* fsel needs to display the current dir (for better context) somewhere
* eap editor is broken - segv in advanced mode
* use .desktop files and move eap editor to edit them etc. etc. instead to fix
* if we want to do icons on the desktop - and as part of efm, i am thinking
  that we have little choice but to implement a .desktop file loader. this
  is not to hard - it's the xml jungle of the system menus that is sucky. the
  real problems are where to find the icons for the .desktop files.
* middle mouse on gadgets as a quick move/resize thing?
* language packs: need to have a tool to load/setup a language pack (which
  means .mo compiled files from a .po, an optional font and a config file that
  specifies the locale and font) and then install the font(s) either as a user
  or superuser, and the .mo in the system or a user locales dir.
* finish off icccm support
* finish complete netwm support
* add a "taskbar" module
* add cpu load module
* add a way to access "all" apps app dir (and dnd from it into ibar etc.)
* add setup/install wizard to seed eap files etc. etc.
* support color classes (gui config  etc. etc.)
* finish clientinfo dialog for borders (netwm props etc. etc.)
* gui config dialogs for all config
* make it possible to disable border buttons/actions (tell theme what is
  disabled)
* Window Border Icon > "Create Icon" needs to copy the ARGB icon data (into a 
  temp file?) and use that as the default icon.
* Dragging a non-eap icon from a border to the ibar should automatically
  create the icon and add that (instead of warning the user that this can't be
  done)
* new fm code re-lays-out a dir every time the queue is processed - maybe try
  to speed this up
* new fm code's file scanning isn't insanely fast - icon size calcs etc. speed
  up for special cases like list view?

  CLEANUPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* bg gradient dialog needs a preview widget. also edje needs to be updated so we can do proper fills for non 0 angles.
* wallpaper dialog needs to select an existing wallpaper when the current on e is deleted. (might need to add a hook to e_fm2 for delete events).
* fsel could do with an optional preview pane for selected file (bigger icon,
  file info (permissions, modification date etc.)
* clientinfo dialog could be nicer - then again it is an obsucre thing.
* desklock's pam profile should be configurable as system-auth doesn't
  always work and the fallback checks might not work either.
* If a user has set a border type on a window, don't bother to check for
  changes.
* keybindings dialog doesn't conform its formatting or datatype naming to
  anything else in e17 - it needs fixing.
* need to do a massive theme spec overhaul. need to namespace signals, special
  named parts that are needed, specific what is NEEDED froma  theme, what is
  optional (in terms of parts, groups and signals). etc.
* default config for shelf is screwy and needs fixing - related to gadcon
  layout algorithm though.
* ipc is a mess. overgrown. hard to work with. what to do? remove?
* EAP cache files can be hit and miss and have problems. move things to be
  explicit reloads.
* winlist should support place for window "screenshot" in list as well as
  app icon
* winlist could divide windows up into blocks - sub-lists within a container
  per desktop (with stick windows considered to live on the "current" desk
  when winlist starts)
* make it easy for modules to hook into ipc and extend it for themselves
* e_color_dialog needs to have an area for favorite and recently selected colors. store in config and use ilist? or store as color files and use e_fm2? or custom widget?
