Enlightenment 0.17.0 - IN DEVELOPMENT... not a RELEASE.

NOTE: Users of DR16 will need to rename the $prefix/bin/enlightenment
file prior to installing DR17 or it will be overwritten.

You can also use the configure --prefix option to put e17 in a separate tree
of its own (recommended) like:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/e17

You will, as usual need to add the subsequent bin dir to your $PATH etc.
