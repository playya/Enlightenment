hi;
I think I've found a bug, which I can reproduce as follows:

open konqueror (maybe other kde applications work too, i don't know).
open a web page on it.
open the 'print...'  dialog
tell it to print it to a file
click on the folder icon, to browse for the file to print it to
select a file and press save
click AGAIN on the folder icon.

The browser opens, but it does as an iconized window.

I just recompiled code from cvs to be sure it wasn't fixed. If I can be
of more help on this, tell me so.

Matias

Hi all Anyone have any idea about a bug causing segfaults
when an iconified window exits ? I see this a lot and also
saw mention of this in the E todo list. Will this be fixed?
I can reproduce this quite reliably by for example
iconifying an xterm and sending it a kill sig after it goes
into iconbox. Is there a workaround? Sometimes I have a ssh
session open and iconified and if for some reason this
session dies, E segfaults. Havent seen any other big problems
so far. Quite impressed actually with E17 .

a little reminder, in case this didn't make your todo list / email
queue, this doesn't seem to have gone away. or, maybe it went away,
and came back.. i don't recall.

After having taken a peek at what is does in e16.8 on "alltray xterm",
the short version is that it uses XMapWindow() to map the client (which
actually is an alltray window containing the reparented real client)
first time. After that, when having been iconified, it sends a
_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message to deiconify.

dj2 raster, heres an interesting bug for you
dj2 i have twinview setup on my box
dj2 i can move the mouse between the 2 heads and e17 sees tehm as 2 heads
dj2 (2 pages etc)
dj2 if i try to drag a window between the 2 heads (say from left to right)
the mouse will lmove as expected
dj2 but when the window hits the right edge of the left monitor it will
appear again off the left edge of the left monitor
dj2 tho the mouse is now on the right monitor
raster xdpyinfo
raster see how many screens u have
raster screen #0:...
raster is there a screen #1 ?
dj2 number of screens: 2
dj2 yea screen #0 and screen #1

NB: in multihead if the mouse exits a screen during move or resize - either
disallow it (warp back to previous position ) or limit resize/move

I discovered that if i try to change the default settings for window
