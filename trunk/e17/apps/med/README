E17 prototype menu editor

Be aware this may corrupt your E17 popup apps menu.
You've been warned!  You can backup your menu database beforehand
by making a copy of ~/.e/behavior/apps_menu.db.  If you destroy
your menu, delete this file and restart E, or copy the original
from /usr/local/share/enlightenment/data/config/behavior/default/
(at least on my system, this may differ based on your install.)

------------ Building

./configure
make

Now run src/med (or 'make install' as root)

------------ Use

Browse the menu with mouse movement.  Clicking on an entry
box will let you edit.

The return key doesn't save changes anymore, now there
is a commit/discard tool.  You'll see a pair of boxes (buttons or text
are coming, I haven't decided which yet)  appear below the edit area
when you start to edit.  The menu will lock until you choose one of the
options, left (green) is commit, right (red) is discard.

New entry, submenu or separator:
Drag from the 'new entry' tool to the location in the menu to add.
Item inserts at dropped location, pushing down all entries.
(Yeah, this means you can't add at the bottom of the menu.  It's
coming!)

Delete menu item:
Drag if off the menu and drop it.  Dropping it on the menu will leave it
in place (although someday this may move items.)
