 * Trashed old interface for a more scalable one 
 * Use ebony.glade to manipulate the interface
 * Lots of ebony specific callbacks in gtk_util.c
 * Background specific stuff, and recent bg stuff is in util.c
 * Needs a good look through cause I pulled a lot of verbatim code from 
   the older version
 * The Really simplified front tab interface needs to be implemented
