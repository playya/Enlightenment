 * Trashed old interface for a more scalable one 
 * Use ebony.glade to manipulate the interface
 * Lots of ebony specific callbacks in gtk_util.c
 * Background specific stuff, and recent bg stuff is in util.c
 * Needs a good look through cause I pulled a lot of verbatim code from 
   the older version
 * The Really simplified front tab interface needs to be implemented

 * Moved to a "gimp-like" interface where the workspace is not attached to 
   the controls.  
 * Added a default bg to load if no file is passed as a command line arg
 * It leaks somewhere in loading/freeing of dbs 
   - It doesn't seem to take out the app
   - Ctrl-n alone won't leak have to load off disk
 * Really simplified version might be a bunch of buttons with dialogue boxes
   to walk the user through tiling an image or scaling it, just having a
   certain color etc.
