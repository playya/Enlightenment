* bug: when we move a note, we cant get focus events on it any more (mouse_in)
* add Contiguration -> Options -> Background (color changes?) (done, refine)
* add Contiguration -> Options -> Transparency (0% 25% 50% 75% 100%) (add cb)
* allow for multiple note creation
* add various default settings
* save notes, their content, colors, locations etc...
