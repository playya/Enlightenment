COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure
    
( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )
    
Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

The modules will be installed to <prefix>/lib/e_modules/<modulename>/module.so
you will need this full path to load the module into e17
