Just the stuff I can think of...

* someway to attach .directory.eapp files to directories
* directory renaming?
* if an eapp is under the arrows in the left menu it will be clicked when
  you click the arrow
* need to handle directories that aren't in the .order file. They come at
  the end of the list
* can also ahve .eapps in the directory that aren't in the .order file (I
  think).
* E17 will look for the .eapp in the directory first before checking the all
  directory (i think).
* need to add monitoring of the .order files and the top directories
  - if something changes need to popup a warning to the user and ask if
    they want to reload the .order file
