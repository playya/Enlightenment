Fix -o, seems to be overwriting anyway.

Fix icons not being found that are not getting the default.  This seems
to be the major cause of missing converted items.

A seperate "strip common appdirs and such" pass.  Keep a hash of indexes
to Dumb_Tree elements, if the current appdir is in the hash, null out
the element the one in the hash points to, and replace the index in the
hash with a pointer to the new appdir, otherwise add it to the hash. 
Careful not to move the already pointed to appdirs.

Maybe setup a hash of function pointers for xmlame to call for each
token it finds.  Otherwise split the big blob of code in fdo_menus into
bite size chunks.

Convert more of this to use ecore.

Code review on strcmp usage, should probably treat XML tags as case
insensitive.
