These are open issues to work on, in no particular order:
=========================================================


* implement file information retrieval, with results
  similar to that of file(1), ideally with i18n.

* implement a comprehensive test suite.

* Issues with monitoring of single files? imon?
  Test dnotify.

* Unmounting of e.g. cdroms not working because Efsd
  keeps monitors around? I currently cannot reproduce this.

* Add a C++ wrapper library around libefsd.
