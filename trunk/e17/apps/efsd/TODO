These are open issues to work on, in no particular order:
=========================================================


* implement file information retrieval, with results
  similar to that of file(1), ideally with i18n.

* implement a comprehensive test suite.

* File types have a bug that under some circumstances
  produce the result document/unknown instead of the
  correct one. Bug in the MF heuristic?

* Issues with monitoring of single files? imon?
  Test dnotify.

* Update efsd_misc_get_user_dir() to also use getpwuid()
  instead of getenv("HOME").

* Move socket file to /tmp to avoid problems when
  home is nfs-shared.

* Unmounting of e.g. cdroms not working because Efsd
  keeps monitors around?

* Add event callbacks to libefsd to be able to register
  handlers instead of having to use switch-case statements.
