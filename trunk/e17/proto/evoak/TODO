New evoak structure should be something like this:

 - Each "module" should contain object types specific to that module, ie. edje/evoak/... more to come.
	- Modules reside in $topdir/src/lib/objects/<module>

 - Every object type in each module should have all it's own separate code.  This means that:
	- All server-side (src/bin/*) (minus the test apps.)
	- All client-side (src/lib/objects/*)
	- All protocol code 
for each object type should be in the evoak_<objecttype>.c with IFDEF Server or IFDEF Client to make it possible to build separately, possibly all in one file, though for more complex types it could be broken up.

 - Each object type will be "dlopen()'able", in other words they should all create their own .la file.

 - Code common to all objects should be broken up and put in src/lib/objects/common

 - Test apps should be simplified/doc'd and put in $topdir/test/client|server

 - Overall structure should emulate Evas whenever possible to keep consistency.

 - Docs and more docs!

 - Read rasters comments in README for more info.
