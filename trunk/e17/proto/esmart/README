Esmart
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collection of evas smart objects.

Only objects with no dependencies outside of the EFL will be included here.

EThumb
------

  This is a evas smart object version of the freedesktop.org thumbnail spec.
  A lot of it is ripped from evidence, and I hope if you need to generate
  quite a few thumbnails this might save you some memory.  Most of the
  original png code was ripped from loader_png.c in e17/libs/imlib2/loaders

  You need evas, ecore from split and imlib2 for loading lots of formats.

  If you use it lemme know how it goes for you, and if there are errors or
  more functionality feel free to let me know.

Container
--------

  The container smart object takes care of laying out arbitrary evas objects
  (including other smart objects) in either a horizontal or vertical layout.
  Simply set a fill policy, and append the evas objects to lay out, and the 
  container will take care of the rest.
