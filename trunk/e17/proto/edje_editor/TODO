TODO edje_editor (not a complete list...only the first in my mind)
=======================================

* Tooltips EVERYWERE  :)

* A new object add must be take a progressive (and unique) number (newrect1, newrect2...etc)

* Font and image can't be removed

* Clipping

* Save back the updated edc source to the edje file

* Embryo scripting

* Make the visible checkbox work (should the visibility apply to the EDC also? not only in the editor?)

* Duplicate objects (copy/cut/paste??)

* Fix strange alpha premul on text with effect

* Use a value in the edje data field to store the editor version
  If no version information found alert the user
  
* In the Add/Remove menus disable 'not in context' choice
