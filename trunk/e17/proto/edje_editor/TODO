TODO edje_editor (not a complete list...only the first in my mind)
=======================================

* Better save routines

* Tooltips EVERYWERE  :)

* Up and Down buttons must move the selected part/description up and down
   (have to wait a way to move the row of the tree)

* A new object add must be take a progressive (and unique) number (newrect1, newrect2...etc)

* Text object: GLOW? GLOW2? FAR? ... does edje suport this?

* Make the visible checkbox work (should the visibility apply to the EDC also? not only in the editor?)
