Introduction
=======================================

edje_editor is an editor for the edc file based on efl
This is a prealpha state, don't expect nothing.


Dependencies
=======================================

 - Evas
 - Etk
 - GLib2  (this dependencie is in program to remove)


Building and Installing libdvdcss
=======================================

make


Running 
=======================================

Run the program from where you have compiled it.

IMPORTANT NOTE: you have to save a new edc at least once before you
can do much of the operation(otherwise the program will die).
In other world: the file you are working on must have a name.


Troubleshooting
=======================================

For now the only place to found support is the enlightenment-devel list
   
   <enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

When reporting bugs, try to be as precise as possible (which OS, which
distribution, what plugins you were trying, and so on).


TODO FOR 0.1 (not a complete list...only the first in my mind)
=======================================

* TEXT & RECT: alpha make strange thing....WHY????

* More handlers on the canvas to move the 2 points simultan and modify the offset. 

* Tooltips EVERYWERE  :)

* Command line at least to open file on startup

* Have to preprocess the edc on reading (for #include statement)

* Up and Down buttons must move the selected part/description up and down
   (have to wait a way to move the row of the tree)

* fakewin: when a limit is reached (min e max) the small handler for resize go haead

* Group rename

* RelSpinner don't have to stop at 1.0 an 0 but ?? (maybe 100 -100)

* make the interface fit well ats 1024x768

* min e max for part

* A new object add must be take a progressive (and unique) number (newrect1, newrect2...etc)

* Text object: GLOW? GLOW2? FAR? ... does edje suport this?

* implement make install and the the load of edje_editor.edj from other place than the source

* Make the visible checkbox work (should the visibility apply to the EDC also? not only in the editor?)


TODO FOR 0.5
=======================================

* Program and signal manager

* image_tween

* remove the glib dependencies. The more it use from that lib is GString 
   and GList. Porting Glist to evas_list and GString to Etk_String.
   

TODO FOR 1.0
=======================================

* Program must open, manage and save all edc file (e17 default theme use as test)

* Program must handle all the edje functionality
