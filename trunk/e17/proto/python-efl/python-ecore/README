BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

This package uses setuptools, so execute:

Install::

        python setup.py install

You can choose where to install by using command options, see output
of "python setup.py $COMMAND --help", example:

        python setup.py install --help

Options can also be set in file "setup.cfg".


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you get the following error during build_ext:

        ecore/ecore.c_ecore.c:14:31: error: python_evas_utils.h: No such file or directory

Means that either python_evas_utils.h was not installed or it is placed
at an non-standard place.

If it's not installed at all, please do so by:

        # copy and extract python-evas to 'src/python-evas', then:
        cd src/python-evas
        python setup.py install_headers

If it's installed at a non-standard place, you can specify it with
"build_ext --include-dirs":

        python setup.py build_ext --include-dirs $PYTHON_EVAS_UTILS_H_PATH
