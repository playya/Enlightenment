TODO:
- add code to properly select a frontend and fail otherwise

- remove all warnings

- search for rippers / encoders and display erros if none are found

- use two state buttons for the rip, rip+encode,
  button_label("rip") =>pressed=> button_label("abort ripping") a 
  reddish button
  
- fix all the FIXME's :)

- recheck the logic on command.c

- create utils.c, string.c

- add a button to restore application default config.

- clarify the data passing between the config and the extrackt config
  cddb server in config should be referenced into the cddb struct of
  extrackt like the ripper, encoder?
  some cd config should be replicated to the extrackt disc info??
  clean this up :)
  
- when reloading config, we need to COMPLETELY free all the ex->config.*

- supress stdout/err output

- add warning / dialogs when closing app while its working

- make buttons play / pause / stop (mutex with ripping)

- add more options

- do all sorts of fancy stuff

+ make the abort buttons work
  * DONE

+ add all the cd tokens to translate to disc data, %g, %e, etc
  * DONE

+ make all progress bars work properly
  * current rip DONE
  * overall rip DONE 
  * current encode DONE } both of this might be cleared to zero when we click  
  * overall encode DONE } the button rip+encode
  
- finish Help / About
  * DONE (about) (after we release cvs, make it fetch from REAME / AUTHORS)  

+ add configuration purger (use config versioning)
  * DONE

+ make save button for the config, to set the values from the gui to the config
  structs. like on exit
  * DONE  

+ segv when closing app. is this enhance related (new free function)?
  * DONE (no need to use free now)

+ when inserting cddb lookup info into tree, dont wipe it out or we lose
  the current track selection, update fields instead.
  * DONE

+ have templates for: cdparanoia, cdda2wav
  * DONE lame, ogg123, cdparanoia, cdda2wav

+ remove wav files after we encode them (optional)
  * DONE

+ add more infp to the status bar (tracks left, tracks done)
  * DONE

+ add discdb server settings and use them
  * DONE

+ clear ex->rip.curr_track and ex->encode.curr_track after finishing
  (set track num to -1 so we know nothing is happening)
  * DONE

+ when ripping/encoding if the output dir doesnt exists, create it
  * DONE

+ integrate with enhance
  * DONE

+ do not allow multiple encodes at once:
  * TESTED, i think its done
  
+ if no tracks are selected, rip / encode all tracks
  * DONE
  
+ config->cd MUST be used (at least device settings + polling) 
  * cdrom IN USE
  * polling/polling interval IN USE
  
+ add statusbar and reflect application state there (ripping / encoding...)
  * DONE
