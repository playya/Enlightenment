Entrance Widgets
===================
- No proper tracking of objects is being done, hence no proper freeing is being done.
- Need more widgets... yesterday!!!
	- radio button
	- check box
	- Labelled Entry
	- Generic Label
	- MessageBoxes that return selected stati when buttons are selected. (Grab what can be salvaged from ew_notice)
		- ew_messagebox_ok(), ew_messagebox_okcancel(), ew_messagebox_yesno(), ew_messagebox_yesnocancel()
	    - all these functions take three arguments TITLE, MESSAGE, ICONTYPE and return an enum specifying which Button was
		clicked.
		- If any input param is null, be able to still show the dialog. These will be the only public interface to the ew_messagebox subsystem.
	- ew_imagelist
	- frameless groups - used internally to build complex widgets
- Entrance_List needs to be refactored to use as common a base as possible. Also, we need to select the first row by default when adding to a list.
