Entrance Widgets
===================
- No proper tracking of objects is being done, hence no proper freeing is being done.
- Need more widgets... yesterday!!!
	- ew_imagelist
- group types are currently hash defined'd ints. should be enums
- use ecore_lists to hold buttons and other *low life* widgets used on composite widgets.
- AT some point, we'll need to use tables to layout stuff. Free flowing with parralel hboxes just pains the eyes
- show that we either need or do not need radio buttons / toggle buttons.
- add cleaner interface for radio groups handling.


GUI
==================
- implement sessions screen
- Modify egui_graphics_selector and see if it can also inherit from egui_settings
- There's a todo above some commented code in egui_graphics_selector.c related to making the preview even more awesome.
	
***SHOW STOPPERS - TOP PRIORITY
============================
 - egui_settings.c currently doesn't save back to ecore_properly. there is something wrong when trying to retrieve tack the *item from the global *items list; i'm too sleepy to do this now. Correct this first, then move over behavior.c to use this.
- theme and background dialogs need a way to browse filesystem to grab from arbitrary locations.
	- fileselector widget needs to be done.
- Fix up Fileselector widget. This may probably need to refactor out the buttons used by ew_notice as ew_reponse_buttons ?
- Entrance_List needs to be refactored to use as common a base as possible. Also, we need to select the first row by default when adding to a list.

Issues that MUST go before tree relocates to entrance's tree
============================================================
- Mem is not handled properly, we're just coding, no free's. Valgrind must be run thru before we even dream of moving into entrance's src tree.
- Formating is currently not like the rest of e.
