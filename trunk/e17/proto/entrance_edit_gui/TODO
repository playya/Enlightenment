Entrance Widgets
===================
- No proper tracking of objects is being done, hence no proper freeing is being done.
- Need more widgets... yesterday!!!
	- radio button
	- check box
	- Labelled Entry
	- More Message Boxes.
		okcancel(), yesno(), yesnocancel()
	- ew_imagelist
- Entrance_List needs to be refactored to use as common a base as possible. Also, we need to select the first row by default when adding to a list.
- group types are currently hash defined'd ints. should be enums
- use etk_window to build ew_dialog, so we can set modality, fixed size, etc, basically, more options
- Fix up Fileselector widget. This may probably need to refactor out the buttons used by ew_notice as ew_reponse_buttons ?
- use ecore_lists to hold buttons and other *low life* widgets used on composite widgets.
	

GUI
==================
- implement layout screen
- implement sessions screen
- implement behavior screen
- implement x-settings screen
- theme and background dialogs need a way to browse filesystem to grab from arbitrary locations.
- The PREVIEW window is just CRAP! We actually should be loading Entrance itself with the config changes into a canvas and displaying that canvas or something. Basically, entrance -T shows us a preview of entrance without running the code, we should be able to kidnap and enslave that functionality in the gui config panel, i'm smelling a libentrance here. no?
