<raster> the 500 was cool
<raster> for the day
<raster> mind u workbench got much clenaer in 2.0 and 3.0
<chaos> yeah.. i was blown away when i used it.. in some ways, modern systems are still catching up
<raster> yeah
<raster> i liked how u coudl do a custom icon for any file u liked
<raster> it was simple
<chaos> yeah.. but it worked
<raster> the .info files
<raster> and it works even when u zipped (lha'd) it up
<raster> and got it back later
<raster> and the icon was there again
<raster> u gave it to a friend
<raster> and they got the icons too
<voidengineer> I think if we could add an option to the file manager that gets made to add file to desktop icon <name> program, then we could have an event attached to a single icon or perhaps a keyboard event that upon activation expands the list on to the desktop to be clicked
<raster> so the icons followed the file around if u rememebred to archive the .info too
<voidengineer> then depending upon other config params they could stay on screen till another callback is triggered
<voidengineer> or perhaps shrink back to a single icon or out of view via kbd event
<raster> so like spring loaded folders
<raster> :)
<voidengineer> kinda but one folder
<voidengineer> aka desktop 
<raster> yes
<raster> it doesnt pop up a new window
<raster> but similar idea
<voidengineer> yeah
<raster> that coudl be useful
<voidengineer> using the main canvas to do transparency etc
<chaos> hmm
<raster> a directory has an extra property of "open in parent
<raster> ie click on it
<raster> (well double click)
