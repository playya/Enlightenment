* [E]ntropy

Entropy is (or will be) a full featured GUI-toolkit independent file manager
There are currently a few gotchas, but this should get you up and running.


Requirements
------------
Quite a few - but if you have an E17 install you should be almost there:


* Absolutely screaming-latest EWL
* EVFS (in apps)
* Ecore/Evas/Imlib etc.
* libpng


Hints
-----

[*] At the moment, there is no dialog to add a new location to the 'structure viewer'
    on the left (coming soon!).  To do this at the moment, change the URI list in
    layout_ewl_simple.c, in the function "layout_ewl_simpe_config_create", and then
    restart after removing the file ~/.e/apps/entropy/entropy.cfg
