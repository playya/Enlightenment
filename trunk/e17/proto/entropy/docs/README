* [E]ntropy

Entropy is (or will be) a full featured GUI-toolkit independent file manager
There are currently a few gotchas, but this should get you up and running.


Requirements
------------
Quite a few - but if you have an E17 install you should be almost there:


* Absolutely screaming-latest EWL
* EVFS (in apps)
* Ecore/Evas/Imlib etc.
* libpng


Hints
-----

[*] At the moment, there is no dialog to add a new location to the 'structure viewer'
    on the left (coming soon!).  To do this at the moment, change the URI list in
    layout_ewl_simple.c, in the function "layout_ewl_simpe_config_create", and then
    restart after removing the file ~/.e/apps/entropy/entropy.cfg
    Currently supported protocols (via evfs) are posix:// and smb://

[*] Some GUI features are currently non-obvious until I spend some time on them:
    
    1. File properties (stat) are currently accessed through double-middle-click. 
       I'm very, very sorry :) I'll make this a right click menu soon.
       
    2. Drag-and-drop isn't quite ready for EWL yet (but i'm working on it!).  To
       copy files, drag a box around the file (files) you want to copy, right click
       on the background of the icon-box, select copy, go to your dest dir, right 
       click, then paste.  Yes - this will get easier.

    3. Recursive folder-copying isn't working yet (EVFS coming-soon feature).  Don't try

    4. Background-setting per-folder isn't quite working yet.  Soon.

    5. File renaming (i.e. click on icon, then on text-label) is broken.  Will fix this soon
