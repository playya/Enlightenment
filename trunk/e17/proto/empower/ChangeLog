5-29-07 -- Version 1.0
	- Empower now behaves much more like sudo itself.  It respects the timeout
	  and also will reask if you mistype your password.  The amount of retries
	  is all based on your settings in the sudoers file.
	- Also, command line options can be passed to sudo as well as EWL on the
	  empower command line.
	- With the massive changes and cleanups, this release deserves a 1.0 :)
