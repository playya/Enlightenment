There are two versions now.  The ewl version will install as 'empower_ewl'.
The etk version will install as 'empower_etk'.  At this time it checks for each
toolkit and only builds the binaries for the toolkits you have installed.  There
is no way to stop it building a binary if you have the library installed.

To install empower just do the following:
	./autogen.sh
	make
	make install
