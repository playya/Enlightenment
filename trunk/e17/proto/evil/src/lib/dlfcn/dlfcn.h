/**
 * Map a specified executable module (either a .dll or .exe file)
 * into the address space of the user process.
 *
 * @param path Name of the module.
 * @param mode Unused.
 * @return A pointer that represent the module, or @c NULL on failure.
 *
 * Map a specified executable module (either a .dll or .exe file)
 * into the address space of the user process. If @p path is @c NULL,
 * then the module corresponding to the current process is returned.
 * Otherwise the module specified by @p path is loaded if it exists.
 * If not, @c NULL is returned. The directory separators can be forward
 * slash, or backward ones. Mapping a module can map other modules.
 * @p mode is unused.
 *
 * If an error occurred, an error string can be retrived with dlerror().
 *
 * According to the OS, the search order of the module can change,
 * according to the value of SafeDllSearchMode.
 *
 *  - For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP SP2:
 *    SafeDLLSearchMode is enabled by default.
 *  - For Windows XP and Windows 2000 SP4:  SafeDLLSearchMode is disabled
 *    by default.
 *
 * If SafeDllSearchMode is enabled
 *  - The directory from which the application loaded.
 *  - The system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory() function
 *    to get the path of this directory.
 *  - The 16-bit system directory. There is no function that obtains
 *    the path of this directory, but it is searched.
 *  - The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory() function
 *    to get the path of this directory.
 *  - The current directory.
 *  - The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.
 *    Note that this does not include the per-application path specified
 *    by the App Paths registry key.
 *
 * If SafeDllSearchMode is disabled
 *  - The directory from which the application loaded.
 *  - The current directory.
 *  - The system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory() function
