The Evil library tried to port some convenient Unix functions
to the Windows (XP, maybe below, or Mobile) platform. They
are planned to be used in the Enlightenment Fundations Libaries.

To get the description of the API, behavior, etc.. run
doxygen.exe in the top level directory, then open in your
favorite browser named Firefox the file index.html located in
the subdirectory doc/html/.

Enjoy !
