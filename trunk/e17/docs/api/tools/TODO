Todo list:

 * The scripts are awful
 * The menu in the xsl stylesheet should be re-written
 * The menu is ugly. Some changes in the css file are necessary :)
 * Some icons are not correctly copied
 * The structs and others things must (?) be added
 * Grouping objects (in evas, ecore, ewl) could be done, with some work
 * The hierarchie in ewl could be done (imho), with big work
 * There's certainly some bugs in the stylesheets
