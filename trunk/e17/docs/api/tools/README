These two scripts generate the documentation of the EFL API from the
XML output provided by doxygen, if you think that the output created
by doxygen is not so good ;)

Prerequisites
-------------

 * The xsltproc XSLT processor, which must be compiled against libxml2,
   libxlst and libexslt, and installed (http://xmlsoft.org). 
   Usually, the precompiled xsltproc of the linux distributions are
   sufficient.

 * The xml output of the EFL libraries must have been generated (in
   the Doxyfile file, set GENERATE_XML to YES and (re-)run gendoc).

How to use the scripts
----------------------

There is two script: gendoc-raster (to make a doc in a style that
Raster like ;) ) and gendoc-gtk (to make a doc in a gtk-doc style). To
use them, just invoke them in the docs/api/tools directory:

  gendoc-raster the_lib
or
  gendoc-gtk the_lib

E.g. gendoc-raster evas
or   gendoc-gtk eet

The doc is then generated in docs/api/(gtk/raster)/the_lib/ and the 
main file is index.html

In addition, thanks to the style.css file, you can change almost
everything in the appearance of the doc. 

Enjoy !
