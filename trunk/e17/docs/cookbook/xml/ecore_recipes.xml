What is Ecore? Ecore is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction 
layer that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, 
timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a 
separate library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to 
make this job easy for applications.

Ecore is so modular and powerful that it can be extremely useful even 
in non-graphics programing by itself. As an example, several web servers 
have been written that were based solely on Ecore and the Ecore_Con module 
for abstract socket communication.
