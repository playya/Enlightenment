  With the decision to re-write Enlightenment for DR17, came the decision to build 
  a support infrastructure that could support Enlightenment well into the future
  and other projects needing a solid base of libraries. This formed the basis
  of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL).

 <para>
  The EFL has grown to encompass many of the features required by the window manager development
  and many of the applications that will be run on top of that WM. There are currently
  libraries to handle transparency, configuration, video, core event loops, and interface
  abstraction.
