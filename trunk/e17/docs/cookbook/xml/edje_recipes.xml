<para>
Edje is a complex graphical design and layout library.
</para>

<para>
It's purpose is to be a sequel to "Ebits" which to date has serviced the needs of 
Enlightenment development for version 0.17. The original design paramteres under 
which Ebits came about were a lot more restricted than the resulting use of 
them, thus Edje was born.
</para>

<para>
Edje is a more complex layout engine compared to Ebits. It doesn't pretend to do 
containering and regular layout like a widget set. It still inherits the more simplistic 
layout ideas behind Ebits, but it now does them a lot more cleanly, allowing for easy 
expansion, and the ability to cover much more ground than Ebits ever could. For the 
purposes of Enlightenment 0.17, Edje should serve all the purposes of creating visual 
elements (borders of windows, scrollbars, etc.) and allow the designer the ability to 
animate, layout and control the look and feel of any program using Edje as its basic 
GUI constructor. This library allows for multiple collections of Layouts in one file, 
sharing the same image database and thus allowing a whole theme to be conveneintly 
packaged into one file and shipped around.
</para>

<para>
Edje, unlike Ebits, separates the layout and behavior logic. Edje files ship with an 
image database, used by all the parts in all the collections to source graphical data. 
It has a directory of logical part names pointing to the part collection entry ID in the 
file (thus allowing for multiple logical names to point to the same part collection, 
allowing for the sharing of data between display elements). Each part collection consists 
of a list of visual parts, as well as a list of programs. A program is a conditionally run 
program that if a particular event occurs (a button is pressed, a mouse enters or leaves 
a part) will trigger an action that may affect other parts. In this way a part collection 
can be "programmed" via its file so as to hilight buttons when the mouse passes over them 
or show hidden parts when a button is clicked somewhere. The actions performed in changing 
from one state to another are also allowed to transition over a period of time, allowing animation.
</para>

<para>
This separation and simplistic event driven style of programming can produce almost any look 
and feel one could want for basic visual elements. Anything more complex is likely 
the domain of an application or widget set that may use Edje as a conveneient way of 
being able to configure parts of the display.
