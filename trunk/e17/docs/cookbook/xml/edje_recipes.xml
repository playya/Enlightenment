<para>
Edje is a complex graphical design and layout library.  It's purpose is to abstract every element of your Evas
applications interface from the code itself.

<para>
An Edje application falls into two parts: the C code that makes up your application and an Edje Data
Collection (EDC) that describes every element of your interface.  The two are connected by signals
that are emited from your EDC and recieved by callbacks in your application code.  Using this signal
model the application code is completely uninterested in exactly what your interface looks like, just
so long as it gets a signal.  And because signals are proccessed by callbacks, there is no requirement
that your interface send every signal avalible, making large scale applications and "demo" size applications
possible with a single binary.  Whether your interface uses buttons or a drag-bar in order to send 
data, it doesn't matter to you application.
