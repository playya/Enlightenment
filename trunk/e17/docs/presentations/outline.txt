What is a window manager and why do I need one?

	* X is a networked display system only
	* Window control system not built in like Windows and Mac OS
	* Alone X just stacks windows w/o borders at requested coords
	* A window manager provides:
		- layout and manipulation of the windows on the screen
		- changing focus between windows
		- iconification control
		- virtual desktops
		- multiple desktops/workspaces

History of X Window Managers and Environments

	* Other window managers (aka, Things That Make You Go Ewww)

		- TWM
			+ original X window manager
			+ simple, colored, small borders
			+ menus for launching applications

		- FVWM and variants
			+ themable through text files
			+ dockapp support

		- Windowmaker
			+ GNUStep implementation of NeXTStep
			+ configurable through GUI
			+ some applications with corresponding theme
			+ dockapps

		- Afterstep (Themable window manager with dockapps)
			+ dockapps

		- KDE
			+ Desktop Environment for X11
			+ Window manager
			+ File manager
			+ Full set of applications

		- Gnome
			+ Desktop Environment for X11
			+ Window manager
			+ File manager
			+ Full set of applications
			+ Implemented in response to QT License

	* Enlightenment
		- Originally hacked fvwm to support pixmaps, called fvwm-xpm
		- Wrote window manager code from scratch and released in 1997
		- Code base evolved until 0.13, abandoned to improve design
		- Rewritten code with version 0.14 evolved into 0.16
		- Rewritten at 0.17 to expand the scope of the project

E16, E17, and the EFL, What the hell?

	* E16 is the current stable version of the window manager
		- Very configurable
		- Large theme selection
		- Supports the freedesktop.org EWMH
		- Remember settings
		- Powerful keybindings

	* E17 is the upcoming window manager
		- Provide a desktop shell
		- Initial code base abandoned
		- Expanded theming
		- Shared code based on EFL

	* EFL has generalized and expanded ideas from E17
		- Layout logic in themes
		- Generic and powerful main program loop
		- Flexible and re-usable code
		- Consistency in API's
		- Heavily documented and a variety of examples

	* Set-top
		- DVD Player
		- PVR
		- Kiosk

How do they fit together?

	* Dependancy graphic
	* Explanation of applications

Future
------

How will the libraries be used?

	* window manager
