What is a window manager and why do I need one?

	* X is a networked display system only
	* Window control system not built in like Windows and Mac OS
	* Alone X just stacks windows w/o borders at requested coords
	* A window manager provides:
		- layout and manipulation of the windows on the screen
		- changing focus between windows
		- iconification control
		- virtual desktops
		- multiple desktops/workspaces

History of X Window Managers and Environments

	* Other window managers (aka, Things That Make You Go Ewww)
		- twm
		- fvwm and variants
		- afterstep
		- windowmaker
		- gnome
		- kde

	* Enlightenment

E16, E17, and the EFL, What the hell?

	* E16 is the current stable version of the window manager
		- Very configurable
		- Large theme selection
		- Supports the freedesktop.org EWMH
		- Remember settings
		- Powerful keybindings

	* E17 is the upcoming window manager
		- Provide a desktop shell
		- Initial code base abandoned
		- Expanded theming
		- Shared code based on EFL

	* EFL has generalized and expanded ideas from E17
		- Layout logic in themes
		- Generic and powerful main program loop
		- Flexible and re-usable code
		- Consistency in API's
		- Heavily documented and a variety of examples
