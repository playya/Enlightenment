The EWL is a library for creating graphical user interfaces based upon the 
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). The library aims to ease the pain
of creating graphical interfaces. With that in mind the library aims for
simplicity and elegance.

The EWL works in a similar fashion to other widget libraries, in that it is 
based on a callback system. As elements are created and added to the 
interface any desired event callbacks are registered and these functions
will be triggered when the specified events happen. This simple callback
method makes it possible to build very complex interfaces from a relatively
simple set of base primitives.

This tutorial is an attempt to familiarize the user with the different
aspects of the EWL. The tutorial will probably never completely
document all aspects of EWL as the system continues to grow. A good
understanding of C programming is assumed throughout the tutorial.

If you have any troubles with either this tutoral, or using the EWL
in general any feedback is greatly appreciated as it would help improve either
the tutorial or the EWL itself. Please see the
