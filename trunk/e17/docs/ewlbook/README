About
-----
This book is an attempt to document the EWL. It is setup in
the same vein as the GTK+ tutorial.

Feedback
--------
If you have any feedback on this book, needed content, confusing
content, whatever, let me know and I'll see what can be 
done.

Generating
----------
Doing a simple make should hopefully build the documents for
you, you can generate a PDF, HTML or TXT document as 
desired.

Contributing
------------
This sucker is written in DocBook, so it helps a bit to know that,
but even if you don't, you can always send the submission to me
and I can fix it up. Send stuff to zero@perplexity.org.
