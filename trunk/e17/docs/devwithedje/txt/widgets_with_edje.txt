We have seen there are roughly 5 kinds of functions that have to be implemented
in order to create a widget from scratch. Altought the way groups are split
might not seem equitative to the amount of work each one might entail, the
divisions are concordant with the shortcuts Edje provides. For the cases where
the number of functions in one group seems to clearly outweights the others, 
Edje provides additional shortcuts not directly related to the design concepts
and design elements we have seen in the previous chapters.
