:Abstract:  An introduction to GUI based application development. Starts from
            the most basic concepts and introduces the EFL libraries that deal
            with each of them. It covers Edje, Ecore, Evas and EWL. This book 
            is intended to cover all the concepts needed by a novice programmer 
            to create a full blown Edje based application.

Book overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I. `Structure of a graphical application`_.
If we look through the code of some of the many open source applications 
available, we can find most of them share a common structure. This chapter
introduces the reader to said structure, to the concept of an Event loop and
how does it deal with the interaction between form and function.

I.I. `Decomposing the frontend`_.
There are different approaches to the creation of Graphical User Interfaces, 
some provide flexibility while others shorter development time. In the end, the
rest of the application will have to go through the same mechanism to deal
with the interface.

II. `Introduction to Edje`_.
Edje is a compromise between flexibility and development time. Comparing it to 
a plain canvas or a fully featured toolkit can show us how it fits in the 
middle ground and provides advantages for designers and developers alike.

II.I. `The foundations`_.
Edje allows low level control of the interface without forcing the developer 
through a low level API. The interface objects are implemented as Evas objects,
but through a completely new language friendly to designers and independent 
from the application code.

II.II. `Convenient libraries`_
To load an Edje interface the application needs to setup an Evas canvas first.
This would look as a burden for the developer, dealing with issues specific to 
the underlying system. Thankfully Evas is supported by an additional library 
that resolve most of these issues, Ecore.

III. `The foundations in practice`_.
Practical examples of the Englighenment Foundation Libraries required for a
common Edje application.

III.I `Working with the canvas`_.
Including new Edje objects inside the previously setup canvas can be explained 
with this simple example.

III.II `Interacting with the objects`_.
There are different channels for the application to interact with the 
interface. For the sake of brevity I will include an example of each one to 
serve as an introduction for the practical examples to come in the next 
chapters.

IV. `Introduction to widgets`_.
Interfaces need to resolve two problems, presenting information to users and 
taking orders from them. The past chapters presented enough information to 
solve the first. In the following chapters we will review the second. The 
widget itself can be seen as a small application inside our interfaces. As an
example let's examine the structure of a common widget, the combox.
