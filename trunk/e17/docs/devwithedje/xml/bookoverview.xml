    <title>Book Overview</title>

<para>In the following paragraphs I will present a brief explanation of the
      contents of each chapter and section. Section titles are emphasised while
      Chapter titles are strongly emphasised.</para>

<formalpara>
    <title>I. Structure of a graphical application</title>
    Looking at the code of some of the many open source applications avialable,
    we can find common components in their structure. This chapter introduces
    the concept of a Event loop and how does it deal with the interaction
    between the functionality and the interface.
</formalpara>

<para>
    <emphasis>I.I. Decomposing the frontend.</emphasis>
    There are different approaches to the creation of Graphical User
    Interfaces, some provide more flexibilty while others development speed. In
    any case, the end product will make available the same mechanisms to the
    rest of the application.
</para>

<!-- New Chapter -->

<formalpara>
    <title>II. Introduction to Edje</title>
    Edje is a compromise between flexibilty and development time. Comparing it
    to a plain canvas or a fully featured toolkit can show us how it fits in a
    comfortable middle ground with advantages for designers and developers
    alike.
</formalpara>

<para>
    <emphasis>II.I. The foundations.</emphasis>
    Edje allows low level control of the interface without forcing the
    developer through a low level API. The interface objects are implemented as
    Evas objects, but through a compeletely new language friendly to designers
    and independent from the application code.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>II.II.Convenient functions.</emphasis>
    To load an Edje interface the application needs to setup an Evas canvas
    first. This would look as a burden for the developer, dealing with issues
    specific to the underlying system. Thankfully Evas is supported by an
    additional library that resolve most of these issues, Ecore.
</para>

<!-- New Chapter -->

<formalpara>
    <title>III. The foundations in practice</title>
    This is a practical example of the simplest approach to setting up an Evas
    canvas for display.
</formalpara>

<para>
    <emphasis>III.I Working with the canvas</emphasis>
    Another example dealing with the inclusion of an Edje object.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>III.II Interacting with the objects</emphasis>
    A practical guide through both Edje and plain Ecore's event system. 
</para>

<!-- New Chapter -->

<formalpara>
    <title>IV. Introduction to widgets</title>
    A simple description of what a widget is and what it is useful for along with
    the limitations presented by common toolkits.
</formalpara>

<para>
    <emphasis>IV.I. The common widget design</emphasis>
    A generic vision of the way the different toolkits design the structure of
    widgets with the corresponding diagram.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>IV.II. Widget design with Edje</emphasis>
    An explanation about where does Edje fits in the structure mentioned before,
    and the shortcuts it provides.
</para>

<!-- New Chapter -->

<formalpara>
    <title>V. Implementing a widget with Edje</title>
    A brief resume of the previous chapter and the introduction of names specific
    to Evas, Ecore_Evas and Edje.
</formalpara>

<para>
    <emphasis>V.I. The backend</emphasis>
    (temporary section name) it will include the C implementation of widgets in a
    way similar to EWL.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>V.II. The frontend</emphasis>
    (Another temporary section name) it will include the EDC Implementation of the
    widget in a way it fits the method used by the EWL developers.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>V.III. The Inclusion</emphasis>
    (Another temporary section name) it will include the method to insert the
    custom widget in the application.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>V.IV. Saving time with EWL widgets</emphasis>
    Introduction to EWL widgets, a brief list of what is available and the method
    to include the widgets in the application.
</para>

<para>
    <emphasis>V.V. Interaction</emphasis>
    The final example showing how to interact with the combination of EWL, custom
    and non-widget elements in our application.
</para>

        <title>Useful resources</title>

        <para>Before we begin I would list a collection of books and articles that
            I found critical while understanding about the Enlightenment
            Foundation Libraries.
