Description: abstracted, generalized xml parser/writer interface
 EXML is an abstracted, generalized interface to an xml
 parser/writer, using ecore data structures and making
 things generally easy to get around in.
 The functions detailed in EXML.h are fairly self explanatory,
 and the io interfaces are also generalized and independent
 (open from a socket, write to in memory xml image).
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
