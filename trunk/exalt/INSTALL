Use theses classics commands to compile and install exalt :
- ./autogen.sh
- make
- (as root) make install


wpa_supplicant is required to compile exalt, the executable can be found by the configure script or can be specified in the command line. With some distributions a simple user does'nt have wpa_supplicant in his path, consequently you have to specified its location in the command line :

- ./autogen.sh --with-wpa_supplicant=/sbin/wpa_supplicant


dhclient is not required by exalt but if you don't have it, you can not use dhcp. As for wpa_supplicant, the path of dhclient can be specified in the command line :
