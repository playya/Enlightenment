To build and install empower, do the following:
	./autogen.sh
	make
	make install (as root)

By default the Elementary version will be built unless it's not installed
or the EWL version is explicitly enabled by passing --enable-ewl to autogen.sh.
The program will build and install as 'empower' in either case.  Both versions
cannot be installed at the same time without renaming the resulting binary
manually.
