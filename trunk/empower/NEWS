	Version 2.0.0 released
	  - An Elementary based version of empower now exists and is the
			default version that gets built.  The EWL version is still
			around for those who love it, but will need to be explicitly
			enabled.
5-31-07:
	Version 1.5 released
		- This version should hopefully appease alot of the people who have
		  been asking for new features.  If anyone needs it, I might add some
		  support for opening things in a terminal.  It would probably be a 
		  command line option/symlink since having a check would ruin the nice
		  interface :)  For now though this could be a achieved by running your
		  term with the correct args to open a program.
