@section intro What is Eeze?

Eeze is a library for manipulating devices through udev with a simple and fast
api. It interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as
udisks/upower or hal, to immediately gather device information the instant it
becomes known to the system.  This can be used to determine such things as:
@li If a cdrom has a disk inserted
@li The temperature of a cpu core
@li The remaining power left in a battery
@li The current power consumption of various parts
@li Monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices
  
Each of the above examples can be performed by using only a single eeze
function, as one of the primary focuses of the library is to reduce the
complexity of managing devices.

	@li @ref watch Functions that watch for events
	@li @ref syspath Functions that accept a device /sys/ path
	@li @ref find Functions which find types of devices
