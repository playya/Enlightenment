Eeze is a library for manipulating devices through udev with a simple and fast api.
It interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as udisks/upower
or hal, to immediately gather device information the instant it becomes known to
the system.  This can be used to determine such things as:
  *if a cdrom has a disk inserted
  *the temperature of a cpu core
  *the remaining power left in a battery
  *the current power consumption of various parts
  *monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices
Each of the above examples can be performed by using only a single eeze function,
as one of the primary focuses of the library is to reduce the complexity of
managing devices.
