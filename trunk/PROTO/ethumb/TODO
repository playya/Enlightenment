 * documentation (based on python bindings)
   * Ethumb
   * Ethumb_Client

 * memory handling:
   * zero pointer parameters before failing on SAFETY macros (file_get, etc)

 * callback:
   * const void *data on function registration, cast when call.
   * give generated_cb the Ethumb_Client parameter.
   * fix types to include Ethumb and Ethumb_Client prefix, make names
     like any other EFL callback, or just remove the typedef.

 * unit tests, be them in C or Python, covering:
   * thumbnail generation respect parameters (size, format...)
   * respect fdo standards (hash, location, etc, uri with spaces...)
   * server died recovery, just add timeout and kill server before expires

 * examples:
   * error handling, including reconnection.
