Description: An audio CD ripper and encoder based on the EFL
 Extrackt is essentially an audio CD ripper and encoder. It
 allows you to choose your ripper and encoder based on
 templates which give Extrackt the ability to use multiple
 built in and user defined ones. Extrackt is logically  split
 into a frontend (gui) and a backend (ripping / encoding /
 cddb etc.) and allows for frontends to be written using any
 toolkit like Etk, Ewl, Gtk, or even pure Evas / Edje (not to
 mention ncurses or simlpe shell ones).
