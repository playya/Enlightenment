Shellementary application

This is an application made as a replacement for "zenity" but in Python-Elementary.
It supports now most of parameters of zenity(and i plan to add all)

WHY THIS NAME?

Because it is made in Elementary toolkit and it is made for use in shell scripts. :)

INSTALLATION:

default prefix is /usr if you don't set it.

first build it:

python setup.py build --prefix=YOURPREFIX

then install(under root if you need to write to /usr for example):

python setup.py install --prefix=YOURPREFIX
