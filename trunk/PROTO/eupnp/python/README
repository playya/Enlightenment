PYTHON BINDINGS FOR EUPNP


REQUIREMENTS
============

 * Eupnp
 * Eupnp-Ecore
 ** Ecore       (indirect, Eupnp-Ecore dependency)
 * Cython >= 0.9.8
 * Python >= 2.4
 * Python-setuptools >= 0.6_rc3


BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

For most users, execute build.sh for building the bindings. You may choose where
to install it (--prefix, --home, --system). PYTHONPATH (installation directory)
environment variable is usually required.

For example:

    sudo PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages ./build.sh --prefix=/usr/local


The build.sh script will build and install only the headers on the specified
location. This installation will link to your eupnp/python folder, so you
shouldn't delete it.

An alternative is to perform a full install (which copies everything):

    sudo python setup.py install

You can choose where to install by using command options, see output
of "python setup.py <command> --help", example:

    python setup.py install --help

Options can also be set in file "setup.cfg".
