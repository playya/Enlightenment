Etk_Server - Program Etk using any language (*)

Etk_Server allows Etk applications to be programmed using almost any
language. The user interacts with a fifo that allows for the sending of
commands, receiving of output, and event programming. Examples can be found
in the examples directory.

(*) Language should support interacting with files / fifos. This is not a
total replacement for full blown C programs using Etk.
