The Evil library tried to port some convenient Unix functions
to the Windows (XP, maybe below, or Mobile) platform. They
are planned to be used in the Enlightenment Fundations Libaries.

To get informations on how to install that library, see the
INSTALL file. For mingw32ce or cegcc users, look at the end
of that INSTALL file to have precise informations on how to
configure the library.

To get the description of the API, behavior, etc.. run
doxygen.exe in the top level directory, then open in your
favorite browser named Firefox the file index.html located in
the subdirectory doc/html/.

Enjoy !
