BUG REPORTED
- It doesn't seem to kill the dbus-launch programs after you exit your WM.
- Some other weird problems: such as some kde programs such as okular
  fail to register with the dbus system after sometime (usually a couple
  of hours). I have come across this same problem once while using lxdm
  (lxdm itself has other problems).
