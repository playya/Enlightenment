<raster> just abstract the source fetching
* dileX has quit (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))
* bluebugs (n=cedric@enlightenment/developer/cedric) has joined #edevelop
<raster> so its an easy-to remove, add file that handles fetchign from a source and the protoicol needed
* dileX_ is now known as dileX
<devilhorns> yea
<raster> so if the 2 sources there now dont work - we can add more for people
<devilhorns> like a plugin system or something
<raster> even have it be smart and qwhen u select a location for weather
<raster> it queries ALL weather back ends to ask if they cover thatplace
<quaker66> how about when two backends support one place? :P
