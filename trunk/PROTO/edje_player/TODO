- read window size from Edje file

- load multible Edje in a session

- display an optional resize handle for borderless windows

- currently it's not possible to overwrite negative options if set in datablock
  if set also on commandline (e.g. borderless=true is set in data block; then
  it's not possible to activate borders with command line switch). Solution
  would be to use -b <int> as command line switch.
