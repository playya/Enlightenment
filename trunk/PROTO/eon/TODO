ST = Short Term
MT = Mid Term
LT = Long Term

Core
====
+ Merge eon_shape_sauqre and eon_paint_square, define an interface
+ Make the Eon_Canvas be a child of Eon_Paint, make the Ekeko_Canvas an interface
+ Replace every foo_new(Canvas *) with a foo_new(Document *d) so the document
  element works as a factory to trigger "new object" event
+ Instantiable tpyes should not export the struct, just an opaque handler, as it is not allowed to do a subtype from them
+ Move ekeko objects to eon object (renderable, canvas, input)
+ Add a grid layout
+ Define the instantiable objects and the possible inheritance they might have, this will ease the external object creation
  and simplify the things internally

Bin
===
+ Create an Eon builder (LT)
+ Add engine specific options to the command line (ST)

Paint
=====
+ Add a shm loader. Use ESHM for that and the new enesim_surface_new_allocator_from (ST)

Core
====
+ Move etch into its own thread. Create a fifo to receive events from etch and then select() it on main thread. Then etk2 should
  set the attributes and only the final version should be displayed to avoid delayed rendering. (MT)
+ Do some research on changing from xml to another format, maybe using yacc/lex (LT)

======
+ Add an Ellipse shape (ST)

Parser
======
+ Clean the exml parser (ST)
+ Remove the exml parser in favor of the expat parser (MT)
