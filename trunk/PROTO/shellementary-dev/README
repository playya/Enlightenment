Shellementary application

This is an application made as a replacement for "zenity" but in Elementary.
It supports now most of parameters of zenity(and i plan to add all)

WHY THIS NAME?

Because it is made in Elementary toolkit and it is made for use in shell scripts. :)

INSTALLATION

To build and install it, do the following:
	./autogen.sh
	make
	make install (as root)
	
USAGE

See --help parameter. If some dialog has extra parameters than standard, you can do for example
	shellementary --scale --help

If you want to use Shellementary on touchscreen devices like PDAs(= you want support for finger size
to scale buttons etc for fingers), make environment variable SHELM_TOUCHSCREEN with any value
and it will then support elementary's finger size thing.
