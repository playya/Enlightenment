[todo] Need to put the mdi_area into a scrollview, so that the window doesn't resize when you move the mdi_windows to the edje

[bug] The mdi_window jumps on mouse-down

[todo] change the mdi_area background to the checkers again

================ Old bugs =====================
[bug] the edje part grows when its hidden and shown again (evas_object_geometry_get doesn't seem to return the correct values);

[bug] make the edje parts move/resize with the canvas

[bug] we need the total number of rows in the tree, so that we can keep the output tree to a limited size
