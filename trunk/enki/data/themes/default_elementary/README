detour 0.7.x (symetrika)

In the works since September of 2005. It began as a port of the
detroit Enlightenment-DR16 theme. Differences in design and goals 
were so different that it was no longer a port, rather a detour. 

detour logo is based on the CLUB font by Marcio Hirosse 
[http://www.fabrikadetypos.com.br], and used with permission. 
Hybrid letter based on CLUB's letter "d".
