elm_tsuite guide
------------
elm_tsuite.sh is a tool to run and test Elementary applications.
This script is using pixel-comparison of your application screenshot
to detect any changes in your application window.

Do not use this to test any animation or any other time-critical application.

The elm_tsuite.sh utilizes shot-elm-engine, which supports only single window application.


Prerequisites
------------
1. You need to install "ImageMagick" in order to do a complete comparison.

2. In order to run elm_tsuite.sh you need to prepare a file containing list
   of applications to run.
   The file format is as follows:
   TestName Delay Executable Name Parameters for executable (if any)

   TestName - A name with NO spaces.
              Later, elm_tsuite will produce screenshot file named TestName*

   Delay - floating point value of delay before making screenshot.
           0.5 represents half-a-second

   Executable name - your application exe.
                     Again, no spaces allowed.

   Parameters - Optional parameters to be sent to your executable.

Example of test-file line:
ToggleTest 0.2 elementary_test "Toggle"

The above would run a test named "ToggleTest".
Screenshot will be taken 0.2 seconds after starting your application.
The executable name is: elementary_test
And executable parameter is: "Toggle"

Testfile may contain comments. A comment is a line starting with a '#'.

You may look at example of this file at "elementary.txt"


There are two modes to run elm_tsuite.sh
------------------------------------
1. Init mode
   Use this to produce screenshot of your application to be used for comparison.
   This mode does not run a comparison.
   It would just produce a TestName.original.* screenshot file
   To do this just run elm_tsuite as follows:
   ./elm_tsuite.sh TestFile.txt o

2. Comparison mode
   To compare current screenshot of your application with an original screenshot.
   Just do:
   ./elm_tsuite.sh TestFile.txt

The way to work with elm_tsuite.sh is to produce "original" files with init-mode.
Then compare the current screenshot of your application using comparison-mode.

When done running comparison-mode you get an output of how many test failed.
You may review the result by checking the TestName.comp* files produced.
