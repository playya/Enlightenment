major things to do here
------------------------

* autoconf/automake scripts so i can run this thing outside of the src dir
* error checking... you don't actually expect a .sh file to load as image, eh?
* thumbnailing
* image boundary box
* image info/exif data
* zoom in/zoom out needs to be better
* drag and drop
* maybe some more eyecandy, we'll see
