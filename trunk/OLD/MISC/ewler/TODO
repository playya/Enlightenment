Known Issues:

forms:
	After a service operation is performed on widgets (break layout, align, 
delete), no selects can occur to other widgets.
		- FIXED: widget_under_cursor was not reset on right mouse click

	Layering of the selected widget fails on align boxes that contain other
widgets (i.e. the selectors do not appear above the child widgets)
		- FIXED: some layer magic helped this problem out

	The right click menu for widgets in align boxes is clipped by the child widget
instead of being above it.
	configures in the children of the top level overlay's selector widgets (boxes)
have policies wherein the width and height are swapped at regular intervals.
	
inspector:
	certain fields are not currently updated (current most notably).
		- FIXED: code awfulness in widget.c:fg_configure was to blame.

widgets:
	widgets which are moved beyond their clip box enter an non-breaking configure
loop.  really stinks.

ui:
	dialogs are not sized correctly under e

TODO:

ui:
	undo and history support

projects:
	add source files to projects for parsing into cb manager, as well as making
project management scripts (autofoo, makefile, etc)
	add spec file additions into projects
	check for duplicate names (file and form) names on add

inspector:
	(also xml spec) allow for formatting conventions of numerics
	present indexed struct elements in order

tools:
	iconize the rest of the core widgets

widgets:
	add a property manager for interesting container widget types (trees/table/
combo, etc)
	
callback manager:
	yeah, get this done
		- IMPLEMENTED 8/15/2005
	next step is code parser

ewl_uic:
	this one too
