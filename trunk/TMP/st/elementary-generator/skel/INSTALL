Configure step let you choose where the package should be installed,
where resources like images or binaries are located and even
optimization flags.

If you got a official release tar archive do:

generate "configure" use:
    ./autogen.sh

It will run "configure" script for you.

Common configure options follows, they can be combined.

  * Debug:
      ./configure CFLAGS="-O0 -g"

  * Optimized:
      ./configure CFLAGS="-O2 -fvisibility=hidden -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math" LDFLAGS="-fvisibility=hidden -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--hash-style=gnu -Wl,--enable-new-dtags"

  * Install to other directory other than /usr/local:
      ./configure --prefix="/usr"
