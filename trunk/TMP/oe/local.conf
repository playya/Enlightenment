# NOTE: Do NOT use $HOME in your paths, BitBake does NOT expand ~ for you.  If you
# must have paths relative to your homedir use ${HOME} (note the {}'s there
# you MUST have them for the variable expansion to be done by BitBake).  Your
# paths should all be absolute paths (They should all start with a / after
# expansion.  Stuff like starting with ${HOME} or ${TOPDIR} is ok).

# So far, angstrom.conf sets ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION
# to generate binary locale packages at build time using qemu-native and
# thereby guarantee i18n support on all devices. If your build breaks on 
# qemu-native consider disabling ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION (note that
# this breaks i18n on devices with less than 128MB RAM) or installing
# a working third-party qemu (e.g. provided by your distribution) and
# adding qemu-native to ASSUME_PROVIDED. Caveat emptor, since third-party
# qemus lack patches needed to work with various OE targets.
