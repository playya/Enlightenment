This is a setup of my Openembedded Development environment for building whole
system images for embedded devices. to begin, please run:

How do you get this tree?

  cd ~/
  svn co http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e/trunk/TMP/oe

Now what?
  
  ./oe-install.sh

Then I want my images and packages. Now what do i do?

  ./oe-build-illume.sh

Images and packages will be in tmp.*/deploy/glibc/ and al sources in sources/
To reflash a Freerunner try:

  ./oe-flash-gta02.sh
