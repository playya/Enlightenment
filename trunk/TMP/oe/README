This is a setup of my Openembedded Development environment for building whole
system images for embedded devices. to begin, please run:

  ./oe-install.sh

Over time more patches will go into the patches directory. Please apply them
to org.openembedded.dev. install.sh will apply them initially.

To see how to apply patches please look at oe-patch.sh. only apply new
patches (there is nologic to mark which are applied currently).

To build an image and package-set do:

  ./oe-build.sh

To reflash try:

  ./oe-flash-gta02.sh
