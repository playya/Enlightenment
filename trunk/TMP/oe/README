This is a setup of my Openembedded Development environment for building whole
system images for embedded devices. to begin, please run:

  ./oe-install.sh

Over time more patches will go into the patches directory. Please apply them
to org.openembedded.dev. oe-install.sh will apply them initially.

To build an illume image and package-set do:

  ./oe-build-illume.sh

To reflash a Freerunner try:

  ./oe-flash-gta02.sh
