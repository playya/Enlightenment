          -~= HOW TO CONFIGURE THE PULLDOWNS =~-


Well, first of  all,  let  me  say  that I've begun to write
a nice GUI for this, so it will  hopefully become far easier
soon.  There  are three different things things you may want
to do with the buttons:


:) Change the menu contents
---------------------------

That's the easiest thing. Look at the button's label, and if
it is "Editors", for example, then load

~/.enlightenment/ganymede.editors.menu

into your favourite editor. It looks somewhat like this:

"Ganymede Editors"
XEmacs          EDITOR  exec "xemacs"
Emacs           EDITOR  exec "emacs"
GEdit           EDITOR  exec "gedit"

The first item is the menu  name,  that's not very important
for now.  In  the following lines, the first column contains
the text that will be shown in  the  menu.  The  second item
(EDITOR in this case) defines the icon that is shown next to
the text. You can use one of the few that come with Ganymede
or simply put filenames there, e.g. dont/know/where/pic.png.
Don't touch the "exec"  token.  The last column contains the
command that is executed when the item is selected.



:) Change a button's label
--------------------------

Look at the button's  label and load the file buttons.cfg in
 your editor.  Look  for the definition of that button  (the
name should be PULLDOWN_<label>). Look for the line 

__LABEL "<whatever>"

in the definition. Change that as you prefer to. Restart E.



:) Add a completely new button
------------------------------

Ok, that's a bit tricky,  so  be  sure you know what you are
doing.  You'll  have  to  edit the config files,  and if you
mess them up, strange things can happen. What you need to do
is

*) add a new button to button.cfg
*) add a new action to actionclasses.cfg
*) add a new menu to menustyles.cfg
*) add the new file to your ~/enlightenment.

As an example, let's say you want a button with label
"Audio". Then you add

__BUTTON __BGN
  __NAME PULLDOWN_AUDIO
  __ICLASS PULLDOWN
  __ACLASS ACTION_PULLDOWN_AUDIO
  __TCLASS GANYMEDE_CENTERED
  __LABEL "Audio"
  __KEEP_ON_TOP __OFF
  __Y_ABSOLUTE 0
  __X_ORIGIN 1023
  __X_PERCENTAGE 1023
  __X_ABSOLUTE -340
  __USE_SIZE_OF_IMAGE __ON
  __MAKE_STICKY __ON
__END

to buttons.cfg.  Then  you  add  the  action  which is to be
performed to actionclasses.cfg:

__ACLASS __BGN
   __NAME ACTION_PULLDOWN_OTHER
   __TOOLTIP_TEXT "Tooltip text goes here."
   __TYPE __TYPE_NORMAL
   __ALLOW_ANY_BUTTON __ON
   __EVENT __MOUSE_RELEASE
   __ACTION __A_SHOW_MENU "named GANYMEDE_AUDIO"
__END

Now register the menu in menustyles.cfg:

BEGIN_NEW_FILE_MENU("GANYMEDE_AUDIO",
     "EMPTY", HOME_DIR"/.enlightenment/ganymede.audio.menu")
END_MENU

And finally,  put  ganymede.audio.menu into your home E dir,
with syntax & semantics like above.  Actually,  there is far
more you can do, like rotated fonts etc,  but that's another
story.
