Move to Imlib2. Build for e16.8.  - This is a quick and dirty port to
imlib2. It's posible to clean/speed up	 things considerably here and

* api/epplet.c:

Fix epplet instance counting in cases where a leftover lock file exists
which contains the pid of a running process that is not the epplet that
created it.  For the fix to work it is required that the lock file can be
locked using fcntl. If it cannot be locked (e.g. home dir on NFS mount) the
code falls back to the old behavior.
