E-PlayCD 0.5.2<br>
By Rahsheen Porter - 1999
<p>
E-PlayCD was one of the first Enlightenment Epplets. It allows you
to control your CD-ROM drive to play CD's. I tried to design it in
such a way that it would not simply lock your drive like most 
programs do. E-PlayCD grabs the drive, sends the command, and then
lets it go. It has CDDB support, a pop-up tracklist, a scrolling label
showing current track info, and a volume
slider. Most of the buttons are pretty self-explanatory, so click
_NEXT(buttons) and I'll explain them.

Control Overview

<p>
Tracks will popup a list of all the tracks and allow you to play one. Repeat
doesn't do anything yet. Config will eventually allow you to configure the
epplet, but right now merely forces an update of the CD information.
