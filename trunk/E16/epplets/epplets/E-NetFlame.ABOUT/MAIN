This Epplet displays your network usage as a flame. The left section of the
Epplet displays the received (Rx) traffic and the right section diplays
the transmitted (Tx) traffic. As with the E-Cpu Epplet the more activity
the more flame you get.
<p>
Select the '?' button to get this. Select the 'tool' button to change
the color that the flames are drawn in (Colors are same as E-Cpu) and the
"bandwidth" that you operate at. This allows for some scaling factor. The 
selection of the 'X' button obviously closes the Epplet.
