This epplet takes screenshots. You'll need to have ImageMagick installed for
anything to happen ;)

Cloaking
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_ScreenShoot_cloak.png x=80 y=290>
<p>
I couldn't just write a screenshot grabber. It had to do something.... Else.
<p>
Cloaking is it. Like it or loathe it, I think it rules!
<p>
Benefits:<br>
o Hides the ugly squashed-in buttons<br>
o Looks nice<br>
o Makes you screenshots prettier<br>
o Multiple instance identification. Set up two instances, one grabbing to
your home directory as a png, and one grabbing to a web resource, using 60%
jpg compression. Set a different cloak-animation on each, and you'll be able
to tell them apart ;-)
<p>


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=buttons background=bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/16 color=#88eeff>
<p align=50%>
What do all these buttons do?
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Ok, so you are confronted with quite a few buttons, and a slider.
<p>
The first two buttons should be obvious. You pressed one of them to get this
help ;-)
<p>
The slider controls the compression quality of your screenshot.
High (upwards) means high quality, high file size, low vice versa. This
option only effects jpg, png and miff output.
<p>
The config button in the top-right changes the cloak-mode of the epplet.
This is kind of like a 48x48 screensaver for an epplet, and covers up all
those crammed-in buttons with some eye-candy. Experiment with the various
modes to see which ones you like.
<p>

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=buttons2 background=bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/16 color=#88eeff>
<p align=50%>
What do all these buttons do? (2nd Row)
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The leftmost button on the second row toggles root/window mode. In root
mode (the default), the button is not depressed. When you take a screenshot
in this mode, the entire desktop will be captured. When in window mode
(button depressed), you will get a crosshair cursor. Either click on a
window with this cursor to capture only that window, or click and drag a
recangular area to grab that instead.
<p>
The middle button on the second row allows you to select the cloak timeout.
This is the delay before the epplet cloak appears.
<p>
The rightmost button on the second row is the screenshot delay. Use this to
configure a delay between pressing the button, and having the shot taken. A
short delay is useful for arranging some windows or refocusing.
<p>

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=buttons3 background=bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/16 color=#88eeff>
<p align=50%>
What do all these buttons do? (3rd Row)
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The left-hand button on the bottom row is used to change the colour of the
RasterFire clock-animation (whose intensity is proprtional to screenshot
quality btw). In a future version, this popup will change the colours used
for all cloak_animations.
<p>
The bottom-right button is used to take the screenshot! Use it when you're
happy with all the options, and want to start shootin'

DO_CLOAK 1
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
BOOLEAN 0/1: This option determines whether the applet is ever cloaked. 1
mean yes, 0 means no.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
CLOAK_ANIM 1
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
NUMERIC INTEGER: This determines which cloak animation to use. Don't fiddle
with this in the config, as you can do so using the popup menu.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
CLOAK_DELAY 4.0
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
NUMERIC FLOAT: This determines the time interval before the epplet is cloaked. Again, this
can be changed using a popup on the epplet.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
DRAW_INTERVAL 0.1
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
NUMERIC FLOAT: This is the frequency of cloak-animation draws. A low value
means lots of draws, a high value means jerky, slow updates. All the
animations are tuned to work best for a value of 0.1, but you have the
option to change it if the mood takes you.

BOOLEAN 0/1: This determines whether you hear a beep just before, and just
after the screen-shot is taken. If 1, you will get audio feedback, if 0,
things'll be quiet.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
QUALITY 75
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
NUMERIC INT 1-100: Screenshot quality, as a percentage. 100 is full quality,
large filesize. This option applies only to jpg, png and miff image files.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
WIN_AREA 0
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
BOOLEAN 0/1: This is configurable from a button on the epplet. If 1, a
window or rectangular area will be grabbed, if 0, the whole desktop.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
WM_FRAME 1
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
BOOLEAN 0/1: If you are grabbing single windows, do you also want the window
manager decorations? 1 means yes, 0 means no. Does not effect
entire-desktop shots.

<br>

FILE_STAMP `date +%d-%m-%y_%H%M%S`
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
STRING: Middle bit of filename. I recommend the use of something similar to
the above. This is command substitution, and uses the date program to give
the shot a unique name.
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
FILE_TYPE jpg
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
STRING: File extension. This also determines the file type. For a list of
possible filetypes, see man convert(1). It'll do almost any filetype you can
think of. I recommend jpg, png, or html (yes html - try it and see!)

Miscellaneous details
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
I like eyecandy. Not everyone does, so feel free to turn off the cloaking
stuff.
<p>
Before you do so however, please do not worry about cpu usage. I have tuned
my drawing code lots, and its fairly clean. To prevent my epplet hogging
cpu, I have explicitly re-prioritised it to the equivalent of a NICE value
of 10. This means cpu will only be used if there is cpu available.
<p>
There are lots more options in the pipeline, among them are:
<br>
o Auto-submission to screenshot websites.
<br>
o Running a script on resultant image to process screenshots further.
<br>
o Screenshot post-processing using convert(1)
<br>
o Lots more eyecandy, 'cos I love it.
