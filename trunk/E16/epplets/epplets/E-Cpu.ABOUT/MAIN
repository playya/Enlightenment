This Epplet displays your CPU usage as a flame. The more CPU activity, the
brighter the flame. when your focus is on the epplet it will display close, 
help and configure buttons - click the configure button (the tool) to bring
up a button that will select one of several color schemes for the flame.
<p>
If you have multiple CPU's the flame will flare in sections at the bottom 
depending on which CPU is active - so if you have a dual CPU machine the left
half is for the first CPU, the right is for the 2nd and so on.
