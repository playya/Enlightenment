evry-mpris plugin is a frontend for mediaplayers that support mpris.

supported players/daemons:
- Amarok, Audacious

- xmms2, via xmms2-mpris-bridge
   install python bindings for xmmsclient, dbus and gobject, then
   cp xmms2-mpris-bridge/xmms2-mpris-bridge ~/.config/xmms2/startup.d

- corn, simple sound server. 
  try it :) http://incise.org/corn.html

The mpris 'standard' currently does not have 'play selected track' 
so this wont work with other players.


A cli remote can be found in mpris-remote. To easily add tracks or 
directories from a file manager (or everything) do:
cp mpris-remote/mpris-remote /usr/local/bin
cp mpris-remote/Add_Tracks.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
