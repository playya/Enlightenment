evry-mpris plugin is a frontend for mediaplayers that support mpris.

supports:
- Amarok

- Audacious 

- xmms2, via xmms2-mpris-bridge
   install python bindings for xmmsclient, dbus and gobject
   
   git clone git://github.com/jeffdameth/xmms2-mpris-bridge.git
   cp xmms2-mpris-bridge/xmms2-mpris-bridge ~/.config/xmms2/startup.d

- corn, simple sound server. 
  try it :) http://incise.org/corn.html

the mpris 'standard' currently does not have 'play selected track' 
so this wont work with other players.
