"Config Menu Module Configuration data needed upgrading. Your old "

"This<br>will happen regularly during development, so don't report a<br>bug. "
"This simply means the module needs new configuration<br>data by default for "
"usable functionality that your old<br>configuration simply lacks. This new "
"set of defaults will fix<br>that by adding it in. You can re-configure "
