Description: Itask NG module for Enlightenment
 It will hold all of your open applications for fast switching and
 is also an apllication launcher.
 .
 There are three basic functionalities that you dont want to miss:
 1. If you click on an icon the corresponding  will be shown and
    raised to the top and if its on another desk, then you will 
    be switched right to it. 
 2. If you drag an icon out of NG the App will be shown on the
    current desktop.
 3. Drag an icon to a pagers desk to send it there.
 .
 lots of other stuff that you have to find out yourself for now :)
