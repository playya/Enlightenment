COMPILING and INSTALLING:

1) Installing to ~/.e/e/modules (default)

Users wishing to install the module to their home directory should do the following:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

2) Installing to a system directory

System admins can install to a system directory by specifying the appropriate prefix to the configure script. Note that the prefix specified should be the same as that used to install Enlightenment. For example, to install to /usr/local:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make

      Then finally as root:

    $ make install
