Thumbnailing needs a LOT more work

D&D actions

Optional source function for filling up a context menu

Horizontal list needs a way to show the category name

Needs a scrollable grid view (using edje_box's 'horizontal_flow' layout)

A gadman-like view/source plugin might be a good idea (for gadgets in a popup)

Python plugins? (3 vs 2.x?)
