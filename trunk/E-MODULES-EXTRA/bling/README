EFLized Composite Manager for E17

By Ibukun Olumuyiwa

"Bling" is a working title for this project (with the assumption that
it will be more than just a compositing manager for Enlightenment). While
it has stabilized quite a bit and may be usable on a day-to-day basis,
it is still alpha code and may occasionally cause a segv, so its use is
not recommended for end users.

Please see the TODO file for a list of outstanding bugs and unfinished
items. It is worth noting that the compositing manager is currently
unable to intercept SEGVs. This means that you won't see the error
dialog that pops up when E17 crashes; but you can still press F2 to
restart. If your display should suddenly stop responding, this likely
means E17 has crashed; press F2 to restart.

Feature suggestions are welcomed.
