Description: Winlist NG module for Enlightenment
 This is the Winlist NG module for Enlightenment.
 .
 it is a replacement for the standard winlist.
 .
 This module should not only look different as the e17 winlist, it 
 also will get a lot of functionality i was missing, for example: 
 decide while selecting if you want to jump to the desk of the 
 selected app or bring the selected app to the current desk, close 
 the selected app directly, show the selected app on the current 
 desk(if it's on another desk), etc.
