To install the module, do:

./autogen.sh --prefix=YOURPREFIX

YOURPREFIX is Enlightenment's installation prefix; alternatively,
you can install to homedir:

./autogen.sh --enable-homedir-install

Then, after module is configured, run "make" (or "gmake" on BSD)
to compile the module, and "make install" (or "gmake install")
to install it. If you don't use homedir install, you have to perform
this under root user.
